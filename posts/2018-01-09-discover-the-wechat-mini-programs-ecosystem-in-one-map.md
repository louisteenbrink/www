  For the first-year anniversary, explore dozens of new local services and great resources
---

2017 was marked by the arrival and quick rise of WeChat mini programs. No way you missed them with the recent mini games out, but surely you haven't wrapped your head around this whole new thing yet.

Throughout the year Tencent, fighting its numerous early-stage detractors, was forced to expand its framework both on functionalities and marketing abilities. Look at the [changelog](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/debug/wxadoc/dev/devtools/uplog.html)... This update race was done at an unprecedented pace, keeping our friends, developers and product people constantly excited… sometimes breathless too 😵

## Hats off, WeChat developers!

Today is January 9 2018, and we all join you to celebrate the **first-year anniversary** of the technology 🎂 (maybe all except for Jack Ma!).

The whole evolution of Mini Programs naturally came with the creation of many dedicated players, some very smart first movers: they identified content and business opportunities, and were quick to jump on the new bandwagon built by Tencent. From unofficial stores to forums and generators…. **A huge ecosystem was born.**

In this article, we decided to look at the current landscape and provide you with a global picture.

If you are now developing a WeChat mini program or considering to do so, you will want to explore all these great resources…

## Categories of players

Essentially we have divided the ecosystem in 8:

- (1) the ‘stores’ indexing mini programs,
- (2) the SaaS (Software as a Service) allowing to generate a mini program,
- (3) the service providers building custom code,
- (4) the BaaS (Back-end as a Service) offering a simple solution to Mini Program developers,
- (5) the analytics tools
- (6) the specialized news platforms
- (7) the discussion boards
- (8) the development toolkits

## Some highlights

Platforms like [xcx.9.cn](http://xcx.9.cn/news) and [xudoodoo.com](http://www.xudoodoo.com/) are already combining stores + news + forums + generators + service… trying to capture the traffic and become the dominant hub! Let’s watch them closely in 2018.

[Aladdin](https://www.aldwx.com/), a leading Mini Program analytics tool, was the first Mini Program startup to raise capital (10M USD in June 2018). Just like their competitor [TalkingData](https://www.talkingdata.com/weApp/weApp.jsp), their data collect allows to produce reports on Mini Programs trends, demographics and behaviors! Good for us, since Tencent has been quite shy on official data…
