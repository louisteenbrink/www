      <p> I recently completed Le Wagon's batch 98 in Montreal. This is the second bootcamp that I have attended. I attended my first bootcamp with a different company in 2015.  When I left the first bootcamp, I was told by the owners/instructors to "just learn Word Press, maybe focus on front end."  To them, my inability to grasp the material without assistance was proof that I wasn't capable of learning backend programming.</p>
      <p> It took me two years to work up the courage and desire to try again afraid all bootcamps would be like the first.  Le Wagon was the complete opposite.  They cultivate an extremely supportive learning environment. The teachers and administration genuinely care about the happiness and success of their students.  The program is very logically organized and the online tools to support learning outcomes are terrific. Despite the many personal obstacles I faced during the program, I was able to learn the material and develop marked confidence in my skill level.</p>
      <p> I can't say enough good things about the program. If you are considering Le Wagon, commit. You will not regret it.</p>

      <p>After working for the government for a few years, I realized it really wasn't what I wanted for a career. After plenty of thought I knew I wanted to join the tech world, more specifically I wanted to become a developer. After countless hours of research, the answer seemed obvious: a coding bootcamp. But which one? I read so many reviews, contacted the coordinators, wrote many pros and cons lists and the solution became quite clear: Le Wagon in Montreal. The second that I contacted MG (the co-founder of Le Wagon Montreal), I knew it was the right fit for me. Throughout the 9 intense weeks, we were continuously supported and encouraged by MG and the rest of the Le Wagon team (even people from far away!). </p>
      <p>The bootcamp exceeded every expectation I had. The structure of the days was perfect, the pace of learning was great and the teachers/TAs were exceptional. My favorite part was definitely the final project- where we were encouraged to push ourselves to learn and grow both individually and as a team. And it didn't stop after the 9 weeks. I am now a part of a community the spreads worldwide. I have developed friendships and networks that will last a lifetime. </p>
      <p>I highly recommend Le Wagon to anyone looking for a positive career change. It's definitely not easy, but if you are ready to put in some work I'm sure you will surprise yourself with how much you can learn in 9 weeks! </p>

      <p>Le Wagon was an amazing experience, first a human one but also because we left it with so many useful skills for our future. Montreal is a wonderful city where we have rapidly become familiar and comfortable in a very tech neighborhood filled with so many startups and entrepreneurs. It was easier to adapt ourselves to this new language because we were surrounded from day one with incredible teachers, patient and passionate about coding.</p>
      <p>I recommend this bootcamp for anyone who would like to change their lives because it did change mine, and especially in Montreal. </p>

      <p>I graduated from Mechanical Engineering and over the last few years have worked for big corporations where things moved slow and innovation was hard to implement. I was sick of jobs I didn't like and working for companies I didn't believe in. Once that realization came about, I started to look at the young and vibrant tech industry as the next logical step. But how do you make that move? How about learning a new technical skill that would help kickstart my career in the tech startup world? That's when I decided to do Le Wagon. What a great decision. I joined batch #98 in Montreal. </p>
      <p>Le Wagon's program offers you the resource, the structure, the support and the motivation to truly learn a new technical skill in 9 weeks. The last 10 days of the bootcamp is when the magic happens and you get to put it all together to build a prototype of a web-app in small groups. My group and I were proud of what we built and had a blast while building it. </p>
      <p>But it's not just about the learning experience, you also get to meet amazing new people, from your classmates and teachers to the people you meet along the way at the different events recommended or organized by Le Wagon. This means that you leave the bootcamp with a highly in-demand skill, a great network to lean on and a web-app to showcase to the rest of the world as a proof of your awesome new skill. </p>
      <p>Le Wagon allowed me to reorient my career in a little over two months, something I wouldn't have been able to do on my own or at least not in such a quick turnaround. If you are reading this review, you are already on the right path... All you have to do is apply and get ready for a 9-week roller coaster like no other. </p>

      <p>I am an American, and because of this many people have asked me why I chose Le Wagon. The answer for the choice is simple -- a friend with impeccable education credentials and an overall bad ass told me she felt "Le Wagon was the best education experience you might ever have". Here I am roughly one month after graduating the program and I concur with what my friend said. Overall the experience in Berlin was unforgettable and was really an on-ramp to a new way of life for me. After getting my MBA I worked at a renowned management consulting firm for 6+ years and worked heavily on systems and applications in the role of a product and project manager. I'd always felt vulnerability not being able to understand the back end or intelligently question my technical team members. I also had put a number of my entrepreneurial ideas on hold simply because I didn't know how to start. Le Wagon has changed both of these weaknesses for me and I feel newly empowered as a professional and a person.</p>
      <p>The curriculum is fantastic. Le Wagon runs their education much like a software product. They design, build, test, and refine ensuring that their education is current and continually optimized for the students. The first half of the bootcamp is intense. If feels like your brain is being shredded, you feel vulnerable, and question whether you can actually get it. Because the program is so well designed there are points where all of the things you did in the previous days suddenly make sense and you are able to start building your ideas. It is a grand feeling, and by the end while you will not be a top notch developer, you are equipped with the tools to keep at it and keep improving so that you can be if you so choose to take that path.</p>
      <p>Beyond the education Le Wagon creates an amazing community and you form a family with the people you attend with and learn from. I had so much fun over the course of the program and made friendships that I know will last a lifetime.</p>
      <p>Finally, I like the honesty of Le Wagon, they say it is for helping creative people learn how to code. There are no false promises about what employment you will get, or what super power you will acquire. It is known that what you are acquiring is the skill and knowledge to put you on a new trajectory if you have what it takes. As far as job support, as of this review there was no formal program, but in lieu of that there is an extremely supportive network of +2,000 alumni and very involved teachers that will help you as much as they can.</p>
      <p>I unhesitatingly recommend Le Wagon to anybody that wants to change their career path or improve their knowledge about technology. It is a great value for the money and an amazing experience that will empower you in the end. Thanks Le Wagon!</p>

      <p>Having a background in law I had no idea of programming (besides some rudimentary HTML knowledge from school) and got to Le Wagon through their evening workshops.</p>
      <p>After my interest was sparked by these workshops I decided to go for the full-time bootcamp and I was not disappointed. The LeWagon Bootcamp is a thought through course from the didactical concept to the content of the lectures. Days start with a lecture in the morning followed by challenges which are solved by the students themselves. Thus, from day 1 you are challenged to solve problems and work practically. In the evening there is another live code session bringing together the whole group. The independent time is accompanied by teachers and teaching assistants who help with any upcoming question - a luxury you will not enjoy when learning on your own and which is extremely helpful as it speeds up your learning process.</p>
      <p>The structure of the classes do not only include coding basics but you also get taught in practical approaches on how to build a website from scratch. It was this holistic approach which convinced me choosing Le Wagon. This pinnacled in the two last weeks where you are building a website based on your idea from scratch.</p>
      <p>Additional to the curriculum we were provided with a lot of extra activities such as weekly talks with interesting persons from the scene, regular yoga classes and team building events. The people I have done the bootcamp with have become friends and besides the knowledge I gained it was also an incredibly fun time!</p>

      <p>I never really had the courage to actually get behind a computer and start learning coding all by myself. I thought that would be super complicated and I wouldn't be able to comprehend anything.  I started to search for schools that teach me all of this in the best way possible.</p>
      <p>The best approach for me to learn something is "learning by doing", so I searched for something doing just that. A bootcamp would've been ideal and so my journey started. I decided to take part in the 9-week coding Bootcamp of Le Wagon.</p>
      <p>I must say, at this point, it was the best decision I could've made.</p>
      <p>Just right from the first day everybody was very friendly. First thing in the morning was a lecture giving us students the knowledge we needed for the day. Most of the day we spent with coding together with another student (always someone else). During this time you had very friendly and capable teachers by your side and no matter the problem, they took their time to explain it, giving the optimal support to learn something completely new. In the evening all students came together again and started the live code. In it we all worked together on an exercise . This created a very nice and comfortable atmosphere.</p>
      <p>During the last two weeks we worked on projects. The projects themselves are created from scratch and based on everything taught during the bootcamp. Le Wagon provided us with the skills and the mindset shaping us into real web developers and with this knowledge we created some really amazing things.</p>
      <p>Le Wagon is undoubtedly an unforgettable experience and it also brings people from all over the world together.</p>

      <p>I can recommend Le Wagon without hesitation. They will teach you to code, for sure, but more than that, after nine weeks you will exit the course with the energy, ideas, relationships and skills to take your ideas to the next level. I considered all the leading coding bootcamp programs in Europe and the USA, and I chose Le Wagon specifically for the entrepreneurial mindset and dynamic culture. I felt the course delivered on all of my expectations, and exceeded them in many ways.</p>
      <p>Pros: fast-paced, high teacher quality, entrepreneurial mindset, robust online curriculum. Cons: honestly, I can't really isolate any.</p>
      <p>My background was perhaps a little unusual for my batch. I was older than most (46) and was founder/ceo of a few technology companies. I was interested in returning to the code after many years, and to immerse myself in a new challenge. Still, I felt right at home and was able to learn a ton and contribute some as well.</p>
      <p>If you are considering a software bootcamp, my recommendation is to go for it. You won't be disappointed, and it may very well be pivotal in your life. If you are willing to give it 100%, you are sure to succeed. Choosing which bootcamp is a personal decision. If you want to find a job as a developer, Le Wagon will prepare you as will many of the other quality camps. If you want to, immediately or eventually, develop a new product, build your own company, pursue an idea... then I think it's no contest -- Le Wagon is really the only bootcamp catering to this kind of creative+technical competence. Go for it, you will be in good company, and you will be very happy you did.</p>

      <p>I joined Le Wagon Berlin in July 2017 after having finished my Master’s degree in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in mechanical engineering. Having worked as an intern in big industrial companies I realized I'd rather prefer working in a more entrepreneurial company or start-up. At the same time I recognized that pure mechanical engineers probably won’t be as much in demand as before due to growing digitalization. Being able to handle interfaces especially to IT is one of the important key capabilities for future engineers. I was evaluating two coding bootcamps in Berlin and decided for Le Wagon, because of three reasons:</p>
      <p>1) They already taught over 90 batches, which means over the time and with all the experience they must have optimized their program and lessons to a high quality level.</p>
      <p>2) Ruby is a stable programming language.</p>
      <p>3) Really good price and time frame.</p>
      <p>In the end my expectations were even exceeded. The teachers were amazingly motivating and competent, I met interesting people from different professional backgrounds, and the exercises enable a step-by-step learning process. All in all you really learn a lot of web developing capabilities within a short amount of time. I fell in love with Ruby because the programming language is really easy to learn for beginners, the logic behind it is easy to grasp and when you’re able to manage one programming language very well you can learn other languages very quickly. I will start a job as junior developer in a few weeks and during the interview I managed to solve a coding challenge which convinced my interviewer, who was even surprised that I implemented it that well, to hire me. He expected a more basic solution after only learning coding for 9 weeks, because I literally started with zero knowledge before Le Wagon. I guess that speaks for the teaching quality.</p>

      <p>Pros: The concluding goal of the bootcamp is having 2 prototype rails project up and running on Heroku. It is very well structured to build the students' knowledge from Ruby, then object oriented programming, DB, ORM, ActiveRecord, frontend tools, and Rails. You learn from not only taking lectures, but mostly by working on exercises designed to hit each point of the day's lecture. Having 2 projects ready to showcase to future employers led me to many job interviews directly after the bootcamp. During the project weeks, you are encouraged to implement features you think suit the project. While doing so, we learned to look correct places to learn about the features and implementation. This I think is the greatest strength of the bootcamp for training the students to become curious developers and keep learning and improving on their own.</p>
      <p>Cons: This bootcamp focuses on learning functional (backend) part of projects. They do teach and use frontend tools, but it is not aiming to train people to become web designers. (On the other hand, if you already have web designing skills, the bootcamp can be a great place to complete your Full Stack)</p>

        <p>Before I joined Le Wagon, I worked as a manager of Bridge SE team of Software development company in Vietnam. I started my career as web/mobile project manager but I always was struggling with my lack of technical skills/knowledge working with developers. When I decided to back to Japan to gain more experiences in the Japanese market, I luckily found Le Wagon Tokyo. One of the biggest reason that I chose it was because all the program of Le Wagon proceeds in English. (The second biggest reason is the reputations on the internet). For that reasons, I made my choice to jump into the most challenging environment.</p>
        <p>Even though I’ve been in the software industry and I knew some concepts to make web applications, the first week of the program was the hardest time for me. It took time getting used thinking like a programmer and writing codes but thanks to the great help from the skilled teachers and the teaching assistants, I gradually started loving coding.</p>
        <p>The final project was the best thing in the program. Although I have participated in the project as a project manager before, it was my first time for me to be in a team as a developer and develop our own product. It was really challenging to build a website within 2 weeks from scratch but working as a team to build a “real” product was the best learning experience in my life.</p>
        <p>After graduation, I'm back to the previous working company as the same role, project manager utilizing the skill of full stack developer. I do recommend Le Wagon if you want to learn to code. It is literally GREAT and I’m sure you will gain unforgettable experience.</p>

        <p>As an undergraduate student, I had many ideas I wanted to put to life. However, I soon realized that I needed to further develop my skills to create projects of my own. I soon turned to coding because it was the most resourceful way to put ideas to life, I mean all you need is your laptop! So I started off by doing some free online courses but the pace at which I was learning was too slow; I needed a better way to learn. That's how I found Le Wagon.</p>
        <p>My experience at Le Wagon was an experience of a lifetime. The camp teaches you not just about code, but about so much more. Being with extremely motivated and passionate people all day for 9 weeks, you learn to develop a work ethic that will translate into every other aspect of your life. You also learn to develop a business mindset to increase efficiency and productivity when working in a group, but also by yourself. The camp also incourages you to go to meetups and network with as many people as you can in order to find as many job opportunities as possible. However, most importantly, it was fun.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed every second of the camp and will do it all over again if I could. Shoutout to all the amazing teachers and fellow students who taught me so much!</p>

        <p>I taught English as a Second Language to international students for two years before finally deciding to make the leap and apply for Le Wagon Tokyo. I had been wanting to learn to code for years, but starting and staying motivated alone was hard. Prior to Le Wagon, I had finished multiple online coding courses - but at the end of it all, I still couldn't create anything on my own. I didn't fully understand what I was doing in the lessons - I was passively following the guided instructions and exercises instead of actively grasping and applying the concepts. There was also no one I could turn to for help if I was struggling or had questions.</p>
        <p>Here's where Le Wagon came in: the bootcamp gave me the structure, the resources, the community, and the drive to finally commit to learning coding full-time. Being surrounded by motivated classmates from nine different countries and taught by international teachers each specializing in his or her lecture topics was inspiring and pushed me to work hard through the long hours each day. For the first time, I found myself looking forward to going to class and becoming completely absorbed in my studies. By the end of the first week, I had learned more from the Le Wagon teachers than I had in my past year of self-studying. I usually have a short attention span, but during the course I would be so intently coding that I'd forget to stop to take breaks. I was impressed by how much programming knowledge the teachers were able to pack in for us in just two months' time. My favorite part of the bootcamp was working with my team on the group project during the last weeks of the program. There was a sense of camaraderie and achievement as we communicated, collaborated, and coded together everyday for hours on end, and all of us voluntarily continued working long after class had ended each day and on the weekends too. Our endless hours of work culminated in the demo day presentation on the last day of class which was a great success for all the teams!</p>
        <p>Overall, I had an amazing time at Le Wagon Tokyo and am sad that it's over now. I'm so glad that I decided to do this program, because I had been very unsure about taking the initial leap and quitting my job to come here. I loved the intensive daily learning alongside my teachers and classmates, the interesting Thursday night events, the weekly Friday night class hangouts and karaoke sessions, the group chatting on Slack with the party parrots, and the immersive final weeks of coding with my team to create and polish our final product. It honestly all feels like a dream now and I'm reluctant to return to my old life and reality!</p>

        <p>Coming from a background in design and working mostly with HTML and CSS, I wanted to hone my back-end development skills more. As such, I began to look at various coding bootcamps and encountered Le Wagon after reading rave reviews and receiving a recommendation from a friend. After applying and going through the requisite steps, I soon I found myself on a plane to Tokyo for nine thrilling weeks. And I'm very satisfied with my decision to attend the bootcamp with Le Wagon Tokyo!</p>
        <p>It resulted in rounding out my web development skill set and making connections with a delightful, supportive group of people who enjoyed their memes and emoji. Speaking of, the party parrot emoji best summarizes my experience at Le Wagon Tokyo. Take a look at nearly any message in our Batch #94 Slack channel and you'll see the party parrot reaction emoji bobbing away with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>The program made learning the full-stack of web development really fun and I felt very connected to my classmates, teachers, and staff. The material we learned from lectures, comprehensive resources, and coding exercises culminated as a group project where we really applied ourselves to build a Ruby on Rails prototype website from scratch. The Le Wagon community is truly what made the experience a memorable one--we were all in this together with the support from everyone!</p>

        <p>I was one of the student of batch #77 in Montreal (summer 2017) and my only regret about LeWagon is that I didn't apply earlier !</p>
        <p>I'm currently studying in Entrepreneurship and before even starting the program, I realized that I had one major issue that I tried to solve without success. I had loads of ideas, but I couldn't transform them into a product that I could test and promote because I was not able to code by myself. I tried different online classes, CodeCademy, Treehouse, Udemy to name a few. After a year or so, I realized that I was not progressing fast enough. It would take me years to be able to code MVPs.</p>
        <p>I looked online for different coding bootcamp. Le Wagon was the one offering not only a coding bootcamp but an access to a network of 1500+ alumni. Needless to say that being a part of that family is incredibly helpful in every aspect. The platform offers you access to a ton of content as well as design feedback, job opportunities, etc. Plus, every single question is answered in a matter of hours. It is by far the most disciplined community page I've seen.</p>
        <p>On top of that Le Wagon is not just another coding bootcamp, the learning process revolves around two main topics. Coding is the obvious one, but entrepreneurship is also a big part of is learned. It would be the best training for any aspiring entrepreneur who wants to know how to code and have a better understanding of the technical part of the projects.</p>
        <p>What an experience it was, while I'm finishing my entrepreneurship study, I am still impressed by what we learned in just 9 weeks. I can now work on ideas and products I wanted to code and have them finished before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>It was 100% worth it and you won't regret it, stop waiting and go for it!</p>

        <p>I took part of batch #77 in Montreal during the summer 2017. With a background in Neurosciences, I had been somewhat disappointed by the field of research, notably its lack of autonomy and freedom. I felt like I needed to make a career change and always had an attraction for coding and technology in general. Doing Le Wagon was a fantastic decision as I managed to find a junior front end developer position even before the end of my training.</p>
        <p>Those two months have probably been my best experience in terms of education. I met great people coming from every corner of the world and with very different backgrounds, but all focused on a common goal of learning to code. The teaching was excellent and the program in itself targets the right skills that you will need to start a career in tech.</p>
        <p>Today, one of the technologies I use in my job is different than the ones I've learnt at Le Wagon but the training gave me everything I need to learn new skills quickly and efficiently. To be honest, it had not been an easy decision to take to make such an abrupt career change but I am extremely satisfied that I took it.</p>

        <p>It might be cliché but doing Le Wagon Montréal truly changed my life. Before the course, I was not working or studying anything related to coding or computer science. I came from a background of hockey refereeing, sound engineering and video editing.</p>
        <p>After completing Le Wagon Montreal’s 9 week coding bootcamp, I am still working and improving upon the final project we built in the last 2 weeks of the bootcamp. I learned how to build a website from scratch in just 9 weeks and now I’m using those skills to keep building the website for my business: zebrasclub.com.</p>
        <p>I also met a lot of incredible people because of the Wagon Talks, which provided access to entrepreneurs and influential people in the Montreal tech industry.</p>
        <p>That being said, the most important part of my experience is that I met great friends from around the world, and we continue to collaborate on my projects as well as theirs.</p>

        <p>Before Le Wagon Tokyo, I was teaching English in South Korea. I always had an interest in coding but I could never manage the time or the patience to teach myself after regular work hours. I was a bit reluctant at first to do a bootcamp. But after I read all of the rave reviews online about Le Wagon, I figured it was time to take a chance. I signed up for the first batch in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>The course is as intense as everyone says it is. You get out of it how much you want to put in. You might as well push yourself if you're going to join a bootcamp, right? All of the exercises or extra work have a purpose in improving your skills. I still look back to some of my old code or lessons for helpful reminders.</p>
        <p>The final project/pitch was a great experience that really challenged me in ways regular code work couldn't: working with peers, managing time, and meeting expectations. All of these are things that I deal with on a regular basis now and I'm grateful for the practice I had.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, I found a job fairly easy. I was setup with a lot of contacts from the tech scene in Tokyo through all of the Le Wagon events. I'm currently working for an e-commerce startup that does a lot of work on Shopify. We develop apps, plugins, you name it, to help merchants and consumers in Japan. To this day, I still talk with a lot of people through the program and will be forever grateful for it.</p>

        <p>Technology is something that I always liked, that's why I decided to major in computer engineering. It was that moment when I started to love coding, as c++ was the first programming language I learned my passion for coding started to grow. I wanted to know more and increase my knowledge in that aspect. While online courses may teach you the syntax, they can't teach you how to solve problems or think in various ways to reach a certain solution.</p>
        <p>After searching for something different for a while I found Le Wagon Tokyo. At first I was a bit hesitant to take the course as I was short on time and the course took place in Tokyo (Japan) which is very far from my country. I didn't even know if it was worth it , but i must say I'm really glad that i took it.</p>
        <p>It was well worth it as it doesn't just teach you how to code, it teaches you how to think , to actually be able to solve a problem. Then it goes to teaching you everything you need to know on how to be able to build a colorful website, backend to frontend and how to use that knowledge to start your own projects or even work as developer which was my main goal from this bootcamp.</p>
        <p>But furthermore, it wasn't only about coding and programming, we also had many activities there such as yoga sessions and group lunches. I personally met many many great people, from teachers to students and many others. I've gained many experiences from each of them, we worked together daily from 9AM to 7PM each day with a different partner, which in a way taught me how to work with different people and bonded the students together as well.</p>
        <p>After graduation, I was finally able to call myself a full stack developer and I knew i was able to create any website I could think of. I honestly never imagined i could learn all of that in just 9 weeks, it was just GREAT.</p>

        <p>Before I started the wagon, I was a marketing manager of IT company in Japan. After few years of working on projects with startups and developers, I felt the need to grow my technical skills and thought a bootcamp of a few months would be perfect. I decided to join Le Wagon because it is the best bootcamp in Japan and, luckily, also one of the best in the world. Plus, I had collected nothing but very positive feedback about this training from my friends / network.</p>
        <p>These 9 weeks of intense coding were probably some of the most enriching weeks of my life. The quality of the teachers, the real learning challenge set by the day to day pace, the new connections with really cool and interesting people, the Yoga classes... I truly recommend this bootcamp.</p>
        <p>What was very interesting and useful for me is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I’ve got to know more about Developer and entrepreneurial culture through great teachers and assistants</li>
          <li>I’ve got to know more about importance of Digital experience by designed, implemented and shipped to production a clone of Airbnb</li>
          <li>I’ve got to know latest web development techniques and Digital trends through great materials</li>
          <li>I’ve got to know what is product Management and how to do it by making Rails prototype</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I think I can say this bootcamp enabled me to build an interesting profile, both business and technical.</p>
        <p>Thanks again to Le Wagon Tokyo! I still feel Meguro is my hometown!</p>

      <p>Before joining Le Wagon, I have been working as a mechanical engineer for more than 5 years and have accumulated abundant experience in the industry. However, I have always harbored great zest for programing and software engineering. So for me, the hardest part about learning to code from scratch is whether I’m willing to give up everything I’ve built up for myself in my previous field to embrace something completely new and challenging.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t an easy decision to make. To start with, I was uncertain about my potential performance in coding due to my limited understanding of IT industry. And consulting the internet and reading online answers only made it more confusing for me, as those are all other people’s experience and opinions and each person varies in terms of ability. Age was my other concern since compared to other students I’m considered a late beginner. Extra effort is a must in order to bridge the gap between me and those who started in college. But in the end, I followed my heart to pursue what I’m really interested in- coding, and everything else matters less.</p>
      <p>I didn’t hesitate at all to choose Le Wagon because based on my research, it is probably the best coding bootcamp available in China. My later satisfying experience in every aspect proved me right. Mentors here are experts with rich industrial experience, but except for the professional knowledge they delivered, the skill that we gained in learning new things is even more precious. I enjoyed very much the company and help of other fellow students as well. Every day was quite fulfilling when we immerse ourselves in numerous practices for better application of the theoretical knowledge.
      <p>We formed a team of 4 during the final 2 weeks to work on projects and I was in charge of the back-end development. Our team delivered an awesome social app in form of mini program since mobile app attracts more traffic nowadays compared to traditional websites. It was a great challenge but being able to overcome difficulties as a team and build up our own app is a fantastic feeling!</p>
      <p>I didn't start job searching immediately after the camp but instead continued to strengthen all the skills I learned with the help from our mentors. Most of the camp graduates would choose to learn something new but for me reviewing has greater significance since it enables me to form a more comprehensive and productive knowledge framework. I feel very lucky to have received an offer from ALO7 to become a junior Ruby engineer 3 weeks after leaving Le Wagon. Despite many challenges ahead, It’s a great start!</p>
      <p>Looking back at the 2 months spent at Le Wagon, coding apart, the strong bonding I harvested with mentors and students is to cherish for a lifetime. Hope Le Wagon will continue to do a great job in leading more people into the wonderland of coding!</p>

And I am extremely thankful for that, it was awesome to learn about the ecosystem of Shanghai as well as the tech culture.</p>

      <p>More than what I had hoped for. I was really pleased with the quality of the teachers, the classroom environment, and the set-up of the courses. I had compared LeWagon to many other physical and online bootcamps, and feel that LeWagon has found a great balance (teaching style, community, price).</p><p>It has also allowed me to leap 2-4 years ahead in my career, as I had wanted to become a technical product manager, which I’ve already found a job in, and had 20 interview opportunities and many offers for PM or fullstack developer. I’m really grateful and feel indebted to LeWagon and the Shanghai team.</p>

      <p>When I heard about Le Wagon Lyon I had been coding for a few months on basic iOS apps. Coding was almost a random choice at first. I needed to learn something new and a friend of mine offered me to teach me how to code. At some point, I got really bored with my former job but more and more into coding. So I decided to quit even though I wasn’t ready to apply for a job as a developer. Meanwhile, Le Wagon launched its first batch in Lyon :)</p><p>I was looking for a quick and intense training that would hopefully allow me to find a job in a startup as a developer. I have been immediately attracted by Le Wagon bootcamp when I read about it on the website. As soon as I got on the phone with Etienne, one of the drivers in Lyon, I knew this was a perfect fit for me. I couldn’t wait to begin!</p><p>It’s been 9 really motivating weeks, to say the least. Every day I was excited about getting to work on the exercises, and it was sometimes hard to get off the computer to get lunch! In the last two weeks, we developed ‘We Dress Fair’, a platform to find clothes fitting your ethic in one click. It was really stimulating to learn how to work with a team of developers and how to stay organized to make the best project possible in no time!</p><p>A few weeks after Le Wagon, I found a job in Lyon at Optimiz.me (a startup making SEO easy for business with homemade tools) as a fullstack web developer. I am learning Node.JS there, a new programming language, surrounded by a great team. It has been hard at the beginning but the bootcamp gave me the knowledge and the mindset necessaries to get started quickly. I am learning new things and I get better everyday. I finally wake up every morning happy to go to work!</p>

      <p>After years studying marketing and e-commerce, I did one last internship. It made me notice the gap that too often exists between marketing and IT departments, even if they're inter-dependent. This professional experience decided me to learn how to code. At first, I just wanted to understand how it worked. But it motivated me to the point of joining Le Wagon batch #52 in Lyon, not without some pressure as I was total novice!</p><p>Best decision ever. I loved the 9-intensive weeks at Le Wagon, I learnt more there than in my entire Bachelor thanks to lovely and competent teachers Nicolas, Cecile, and obviously Kevin, and the drivers Mathieu and Etienne. Coding is a philosophy with principles and advantages: honesty, productivity, team spirit. Coding's also an eternal headache, but it keeps you excited and always more motivated to build great products!</p><p>Spending 9 weeks with the 13 incredible people of my batch was amazing, and I found a job thanks to one of our guest teacher in the month following the bootcamp! I work now at Meal Canteen as a fullstack web developer in Ruby on Rails, along with Baptiste Perrin (also from batch #52).</p><p>Meal Canteen is a great startup based in Saint-Etienne fighting against food waste where we're both lucky enough to work with seniors developers there and learn new things everyday. I would never been here without my experience at Le Wagon in Lyon!</p>

      <p>I have always wanted to start my own company so I chose to study business when I was 18. Seven years, three internships and four countries later, I was done with it but still felt I was lacking something…  I therefore decided to attend Le Wagon batch #52 in Lyon to learn to code and be able to develop my own projects.</p><p>I have to say I have not been disappointed by this experience. During these 9 (intense) weeks, I have had an amazing time every single day, met some extraordinary people and created a great product called Easy Trip, an app to help backpackers meet each other to share their transportation expenses. I learned way more than I could have expected and even found a job I started straight after Le Wagon bootcamp!</p><p>Indeed, when one of our guest teachers offered me a to work as a web-developer in his company, I could not refuse this opportunity to keep building my technological skills, even though I would have to postpone my own projects to embrace it. I am now working at Meal Canteen along with Laurène Daccache (also from batch #52)! We both became Ruby on Rails fullstack web-developers in this great startup from Saint-Etienne fighting against food waste.</p><p>Attending Le Wagon is definitely the best decision I made for my career and being one of their alumni is more valuable to me than any other university diplomas I can think of!</p>

      <p>After short studies (level A in sales and marketing), I worked for a couple of years in call centers (health insurances, Pôle Emploi…) and as an operator-receptionist. But that was not for me. I gave up everything and started thinking about a new life. It's never too late to change your carrier, proof is I just turned 36!</p><p>I wanted to become a web developer. Well, I had this in mind for some time but I didn't dare to really do it, and I didn't know how to start… I first took online courses on HTML and CSS, I also tried another bootcamp but I wasn't satisfied and didn't feel strong enough afterwards.</p><p>As someone who never gives up and keep trying until I succeed, I applied to Le Wagon and joined the batch #52 in Lyon in January 2017. I got convinced by alumni reviews and already had a glimpse of their great teaching skills with Sébastien and Boris videos on Youtube.</p><p>I now believe it was one of the best decisions I made in my life, and it was worth all the sacrifices during the 9 weeks. Kevin (the lead teacher), Etienne & Mathieu (the drivers) and everyone was wonderful, the courses & materiel were  very qualitative. Everything was just better than I expected!</p><p>During batch #52, our drivers organised us some interesting talks with recruitment agencies, developers, entrepreneurs every week. It was very helpful for my job hunting!</p><p>Every batch ends up with 3 weeks dedicated to projets. We work in teams on one Airbnb-like project for a week and on OUR own final projects for two weeks. My mates and I have built 'Easy Trip', a platform to help backpackers create trips together. We had a great experience together thanks to the great good mindset of each team member! And when the batch ended, we all gathered at my place for a week to keep on pushing the project further and learn new skills!</p><p>And the intensive work during and after the bootcamp has now paid! I'm about to start my very first job (and permanent contract) as a Ruby on Rails fullstack web-developer at Keycoopt, a startup promoting cooptation as the best way to quickly find the right candidate for a job! I can say truly Le Wagon changed my life, I finally feel confident and would recommend it to anyone.</p>

      <p>My name is Lionel and I'm from Belgium. I'm a 3D Graphic Designer but I've always been interested about Web Development, especially Web Design. I'll give you some life context so that you can understand why Le Wagon was such a game changer for me!</p>
      <p>After my studies, I worked few years in Belgium as a graphic designer but then I decided to leave my comfort zone and travel the world. I've been to Australia, New Zealand, and Asia during more than a year, working as a freelancer to carry on my trip. During my studies, I gained a set of skills combining rigour, technique, and creativity but something was missing : coding.</p>
      <p>I knew le Wagon for a while but I was working and was busy on some projects, so not able to apply for the bootcamp while I was in Europe. But when I was in Indonesia, I received my canadian visa and at the same time I heard Le Wagon will do his first batch in Montreal in February 2017. It was a sign and the perfect timing so I told myself, LET'S DO THIS ! My only regret ? I didn't apply earlier!</p>
      <p>It was an amazing experience and I'm still in touch with most of my classmates and teachers. Le Wagon is not only an amazing community, it's also a family. After Le Wagon, with one of my classmates, we've decided to work as freelance Web Developers during our freetime and after only 3 weeks I found a job in a great startup as a Front-End Developer ! Plus, I'm also now a Teacher Assistant for the next batch and will do my best to give the students the best experience possible, as I got.</p>
      <p>Honestly, I'm really impressed by what we learned in just 9 weeks and I'm so glad I did it because I can now combine my graphic design skills with web development. So don't hesitate guys, it's 200% worth it and you won't regret it for sure.</p>

      <p>As a CEO of my start-up, I always have to face technical challenges. After a few researches, I discover Le Wagon that supplies the perfect technical bootcamp. 9 weeks to become full-stack developper with a focus on technologies commonly used by startups.</p>
      <p>My experience at Le Wagon Montréal (https://www.lewagon.com/montreal) was really amazing. On the one hand, it offers intense classes and challenges that allow you to understand clearly front end and back end web development. On the other hand, you share with other students from all over the world the same goal during 9 weeks; it is like a second family. In my batch #63 there were students from the US, UK, Belgium, France and of course Québec !</p>
      <p>I highly recommend to join Le Wagon; the bootcamp could open many doors in your career path. It has been one of the most exciting experience in my life !</p>

      <p>When I first came across on Le Wagon website the first thing caught my attention was their slogan: “Change your life: learn to code”. I thought this was exactly what I wanted, change my life, jump in another “adventure”.</p>
      <p>After my 4 years in China and almost 1 in Cambodia working as a Project manager in the garment business, I wanted to go back to Europe and start again a new career. Cause my IT background and cause ,as Project Manager, I always worked with developers I decided that the best way to go back in the market was to polish off my coding skills, which I was not touching since the university times. To me coding always been something boring to do. I remember at the university studying C or Pascal was a torture, thats why I decided to follow the networking path and avoid code.</p>
      <p>But since today the world need coders I decided to give it a second opportunity and study it again in some cool course all around Europe.. and boom! That is exactly when I came across Le Wagon. I made my decision in one night.. “if it’s cool as it look like then I have found the right course for me”.</p>
      <p>I signed in the day after. The first available batch was in Barcelona (beautiful city!) I called them, I did my interview and finally ,after few days, I got the confirmation: I was in! After a wait of almost 1 month, here I was , learning code in a beautiful city like Barcelona, and yes, everything was like I expected It was, absolutely fantastic.</p>
      <p>All teachers and people from Le Wagon they were not just teachers but they were and are great human beings, taught me how to code and how to love it, they transmit me their passion and their will to keep going and to learn something new everyday. And right now I just can’t stop! I do code everyday and I am hungry of learning more and more, knowing that now I am part of an amazing community that is there anytime I will need help. Thanks Le Wagon for this great experience, you really changed my life.</p>

      <p>After 3 years working in Paris as a consultant, among which the past 2 years at eleven, a strategy and management firm specialized in digital strategy (http://eleven-strategy.com/en/) , I’ve decided to take a deeper step “behind the digital scenes”. This gradual slide stems from several opportunities that made me aware of the need to enhance my tech skills, in particular through my latest assignment as a consultant. I worked as a project manager for a cross-functional cross-country flagship project that was meant to diversify the earn and burn opportunities in the loyalty program of a major player in the hospitality industry through e-commerce. I could only be relevant and meet the ambitious objectives of the project if I effectively managed to challenge each team and external provider that I was coordinating. While, based on my previous experience, I could easily take a deep-dive into the stakes of most of the aspects of the project (marketing, finance, legal, tax, etc.), I still needed to fully grasp the challenges the multiple IT teams were facing. I thus applied to do an intense 9 weeks coding training at Le Wagon Barcelona, which allowed me to gain technical skills in both back-end and front-end programming languages and experience the work of a fullstack developer.</p>
      <p>Le Wagon … the very name holds the promise of a singular journey, right? Now, let me tell you a bit me about how this journey felt. I remember the first Monday, when we went around the table to listen to the story of each of the 14 individuals gathered, aging from 17 to 35+, all with a very diverse cultural professional and personal background (investor, former consultants, freelancers, “proven” and aspiring entrepreneurs) … Some people had previous technical experience and most did not. At the very beginning, I thought: “Great, it very much feels like a retreat for cosmopolitan and ambitious yuppies…”. And then, as we moved on with the set-up of our computers and I discussed more thoroughly with each one, I realized how much it would be a challenging and humbling collective learning experience. And that’s exactly what it was.</p>
      <p>On this first day at Le Wagon, I shared my first coffee of the journey (and there were many more) with my then buddy-for-the-day, Hugh Mitton, and we chatted about travels, previous work experiences, movie making and other activities. 9 weeks later, after 10 days of intense coding and debugging, we’ve introduced the MVP of Destinosé (www.destinose.com) , a travel app meant to help people that like perusing the world pick their next destination.</p>
      <p>Working each day with a new buddy as per Le Wagon methodology, doing about 8-10h of problem-solving on cases that did NOT look like business cases for which I could use what I had learnt to do so far was quite challenging. It obviously gave me a renewed and thrilling feeling of being totally out of my comfort zone … everyday!</p>
      <p>As much as it could also feel a little bit frustrating to learn a new set of coding elements everyday without having the comfort of thinking you’ve fully digested the tricks of the previous day, I realized that these layers came together in a very “neuroergonomic” way after I was done with the bootcamp. It is rather impressive to see how well designed this immersion into the vast world of coding is. The material itself (kitt and karr platforms) encompasses the best practices of coding in a very accessible and readable manner. The TAs that are taking turns into teaching parts of the curriculum are all fully committed to deliver digest explanations given the fast-paced learning curve that’s proposed. They are also keen on spending extra-time with students to make sure they feel fully on track. The whole pedagogical team is smoothly coordinated by a very inspiring driver, Gustavo De Vita, whom I feel incarnates really well the very concept of equanimity applied to management. Le Wagon Barcelona is also well connected to the tech startup scene there, which allowed us to meet a lot of interesting entrepreneurs and try their product/service (e.g. founders of GetYourHero, Eoz, Yugo, etc.).</p>
      <p>Slowly, I started making programming related puns and speaking in Spanglish over lunch preparation with my teammates. And yes, we did prepare lunch together everyday, shared it at the terrace of the coworking space, with a sunny view on La Sagrada Familia! Some days, knowing we had to get through a very heavy workload, we would start with a xocolata a la tassa and churros. At the end of the day, when backs were hurting too much for having kept ourselves behind the screens for the whole day, we could enjoy a good Kundalini yoga class at a school around the corner or a tailored session put in place by the staff of Le Wagon Barcelona.</p>

      <p>If you can see from the other reviews, Le Wagon gets high marks as a programming bootcamp. It has a well-designed, rigorous curriculum that does a great job starting you at A (almost no knowledge of programming) and getting you to Z (being an autonomous developer that can build applications). The teachers and TAs were knowledgeable, supportive and great teachers. The bootcamp is absolutely worth the price. It has made me an autonomous software developer, which is exactly what I was looking for - of course, I have plenty more to learn but I have no problem digging into documentation that would've intimidated me before.</p>
      <p>About Barcelona in particular, I couldn't have made a better choice of location. Seriously, if you decide to go with Le Wagon, do it in Barcelona. The batch had an amazing group of people that you rarely find in one place - different nationalities who had all lived abroad and developed the open-mindedness and maturity that comes with that. When the bootcamp ended, I think I can speak for all of us when I say that we experienced "Le Wagon withdrawal". This was not linked to the program and curriculum (as great as it was) but the sense of community that developed during the Barcelona batch.</p>

      <p>I’ve done lots of fun things with great people, and I’ve studied in a lot of places, but never have I experienced something that was such a great experience and taught me so much in such a short time.</p>
      <p>My experience at Le Wagon, Batch #57 (Barcelona) was worth every penny, no question. I can’t imagine having a better learning environment with more supportive and knowledgeable staff and diverse and interesting classmates. We had people from all over—the US, France, Italy, Bulgaria, Ireland, and of course a few Spanish locals.</p>
      <p>Don’t get me wrong, most of the bootcamp was spent indoors, but what can I say? It’s hard not to love studying in a place like Barcelona. Being in such a beautiful setting really boosted my experience. I mean, I got to walk past La Sagrada Familia every day on my way to class. If you’re a Barcelona native you probably try to look the other way, but I think I hurt my neck looking up so many times. The coworking space we were in was modern and well equipped. There were some minor issues with Wi-Fi on occasion, but I believe those have been fixed, and I think the batch is actually in the process of moving to a different space.</p>
      <p>The leadership really made the experience. I can’t imagine having better instructors and TA’s than the ones we had in Batch #57. Our lead instructor was an incredibly humble and personable guy who carried us through each lesson with a sense of humor and an approach that was laid-back while taking his role quite seriously. Since he was the lead instructor, he gets his own sentence here, but I can say that the other instructors and the TAs were also very knowledgeable, encouraging and enjoyable to learn from. I’m still in touch with several of them!</p>
      <p>As far as the technical expertise of the instructors, I never once doubted their qualification to be teaching us. They really seemed to know above and beyond the stuff they were teaching us, and had an immediate answer for almost every question that was thrown at them. There was always the sense that the instructors wanted to make sure everyone was on the same page and that no one got left behind. For those who struggled, the leadership did a great job of giving them extra help while balancing their commitment to the rest of the class.</p>
      <p>Everything was well-organized and there were never any logistical issues that I noticed. This is in contrast to some horror stories I’ve heard about certain bootcamps stateside. From the Driver, instructors and TAs there was no snark, there were no walls up, everyone was receptive and communicative, and took their position seriously.</p>
      <p>To the guys doing hiring at Le Wagon: keep up that good work! You’ve impressed me.</p>
      <p>I’d been teaching myself web development for a couple years prior to my attendance, but Le Wagon really enabled me to bring it all together and gain the confidence I needed to know that I was in this game for the long term. During the 7th week, my small group was able to quickly bootstrap a robust Rails app with several pages and a fully functional UI and back end. And during the final two weeks, we put together a much more functional app that made the first one look like child’s play. Our final presentation was made a success thanks to the coaching and technical help from our Driver and couple of the TA’s who gave us feedback during our presentation rehearsal.</p>
      <p>Upon returning to the US, I quickly found a part-time remote position working for a startup that’s basing their SAAS product on Rails and AngularJS, and am currently negotiating with several contacts at local companies for a full time position. As of writing this review, it’s been about 80 days since the program ended. To add to that, I made some great friends and acquaintances during our extracurricular activities (hiking Montserrat, going out for drinks, getting daily lunches). My classmates were the type of people that like to get things done: intelligent, personable, mature. I truly enjoyed having the classmates I did.</p>

      <p>November 2016. I just turned 27, I was broke like a millennial online-entrepreneur and Trump was president of the USA. "What am I doing with my life?" The existential crisis kicked in. I was too broke to get drunk, not bored enough to watch cat videos on youtube to distract myself from myself. The usual solutions would not work this time. I had to use my brain and come up with a long-lasting solution.</p>
      <p>What is the #1 advice for millennials? Learn to code. I decided to do at least one safe move in my life: go to Lisbon and learn to code at LeWagon. Turned out it was the best decision I've made for a long time! 4 months later I was standing on a stage pitching a web app we've created with 2 other LeWagon students. I've learned in 2 months how to code and I've learned in 2 months more about myself than during the last years of my life.</p>
      <p>Doing LeWagon is fucking epic. It's far more than just learning to code! It's a real human experience with incredible people. Spending 10 hours a day together in the same struggle and the same Friday nights drinking the same beer is the best way to create a strong group. That part of LeWagon was the number 1 value to me (not the beer, the strong group).</p>
      <p>Some people would say "it's possible to learn alone how to code! You don't need a bootcamp" And they are right. But I prefer have an incredible experience during 2 intensive months with great teachers and awesome teammates.</p>
      <p>Doing LeWagon is fail-proof. Don't think Udemy or CodeCademy are alternatives to real bootcamp. It's really hard to discipline yourself to learn to code and most people take too much time to learn. It's hard but nobody wanted to give up, because the days you hate code you still come for people and patient teachers, and you end up loving code again.</p>
      <p>Don't think code is not for you. Code is a tool anyone can use and learn. People around me told me that I wouldn't like code. Because I'm more of a dreamer and a creative who doesn't pay attention to details and doesn't really like to follow the rules. Anyone can learn and love code in different manners. Creatives love the possibilities it offers, entrepreneurs love the scalability and opportunities it gives you access to, meticulous people love spending time on their code and making great craft, hard core brains love the challenge and rewards it gives.</p>
      <p>After Le Wagon I kept working online. But now I can create a prototype of any of my ideas quickly and outsource code knowing what's going on. I know I can create anything or learn any new language/technology if I put enough time on it. So if you're young, full of ideas and want to make the best investment in time, energy and money of your career. Do Le Wagon. If you don't learn to code, a robot will take your job and a programmer will take your girlfriend. Learn to code.</p>

      <p>I have a background in Graphic Design, working with front end for two years when I decided to do a programing bootcamp. I had a few ideas of web apps I’d like to develop myself and although the online tutorials were slowly helping me understand programing, I felt like I was a long way from creating something myself, so I decided to take a programing bootcamp.</p>
      <p>Searching for a bootcamp that matched my needs was a bit overwhelming, there are many options out there, but I felt like Le Wagon had the most complete curriculum of all the other bootcamps I encountered. From the many bootcamp options I saw back home in the US, I chose Le Wagon Lisbon and honestly couldn’t have been more satisfied with the experience.</p>
      <p>The program was fast paced, they covered many technologies in only 9 weeks, sometimes it was hard to process so much information, especially for me who considered myself a beginner, but I trusted the curriculum and the feedback from the teachers and it paid off at the end. I look back now and see how much I’ve learned and how much I’ve accomplished in only 9 weeks, it’s incredible. I now feel much more confident to start my own web apps and most importantly, I feel like I can learn any coding languages using the process I learned from Le Wagon.</p>
      <p>The other aspect of the program, that I had never expected before starting, was the connection with the other students, TAs, teachers and the driver - I immediately felt at home with them. Today I can say I am part of a strong community of developers and have true friends around the world, people I will always see as inspiration to continue coding and building products.</p>
      <p>As far as the location… Lisbon is just AWESOME! When we were not coding, we were out having fun, experiencing the city’s amazing gastronomic scene, visiting historic places, museums, castles, surfing and enjoying the beautiful city. It couldn’t have been better.</p>
      <p>Le Wagon was an intensive 9 week experience (emphasis on the last two weeks, when we developed our final project), filled with knowledge, new experiences, challenges and new opportunities. I have returned home with a strong foundation to start a new stage of my life and look forward to being part of the Le Wagon alumni community!</p>

      <p>I just graduated from a Business School with a Master of Science in Digital Marketing. During my internships, I had the opportunity to work on various digital projects, however, I was always frustrated not to work on the technical aspects of these projects, and not to be able to correctly understand how developers work. After meeting a former schoolmate who also did Le Wagon, I thought about it and decided to dedicate 9 weeks to learn how to code.</p>
      <p>As a "marketing specialist", I think it was a strong asset to combine it with technical knowledge for my future career. Moreover, coding always intrigued me and it was the perfect opportunity to learn it, because it is quite hard to do it by ourselves. So I joined Le Wagon in January 2017 as member of Paris Batch #59.</p>
      <p>These 9 weeks are very intense, but I learnt so many things! Thanks to Le Wagon, I have been able to understand what is coding, to discover several languages, how a program is set up, how to make it work, and, eventually, how to think as a developer. The team is very motivating, the atmosphere is dynamic, and I strongly recommand Le Wagon if you are curious and interested about learning how to code.</p>

      <p>My name is Anne-Sophie, and I was part of Le Wagon Batch #59 in Paris - which ended in March 2017. I was nothing close to coding or tech...  I first majored in English Literature, then switched to Human Resources. I worked 7years in an international company but realized I wanted to use my skills to help people rather than help a company.</p>
      <p>My first drive to learn about coding came from the frustration I experienced in one of my assignments in my previous job: I was part of a project to implement an information system to facilitate human resources management - and I got to see how HR people and developers could hardly understand each other… which put the whole project at risk.</p>
      <p>Add to this that data-driven technology can also be a blessing for people outside their job to define their own career paths without having to rely on HR people within the company they belong to. I wanted to know more about coding in order to be able to bring to people this kind of tool to redesign their worklife.</p>
      <p>In retrospect, I like to see Le Wagon bootcamp as a big Lego challenge:</p>
      <p>In the first 6 weeks, you learn about all the different bricks that you can use, what you can do with each of them and how to put them together. During this phase, you’re deep in code but the philosophy is really to get support to understand how the bricks work: you’re surrounded with teachers, teaching assistants whom you can call when you are lost. You learn to develop the right reflex to work on your own. And part of the success of this bootcamp comes from the perfect balance between theory (just what you need to understand the big picture) and practice (gradual challenges throughout the day and the course) - I've seen a lot of training programs in my previous jobs but none were close to matching Le Wagon's in getting you to really acquire skills that quickly.</p>
      <p>then in the last 3 weeks, you use all the bricks you have learnt about to build real projects, working in a team. The outtake of this part of the bootcamp is even greater as you’re coding for real, not in a sandbox, with all the constraints you will encounter in any job (time-induced stress, teamwork, communication, etc), till the final presentation during the Demo Day. Not only you get to learn code, you also learn how to start a project by defining it clearly, pitching it and marketing it - a very valuable skill when you’re aiming at launching your startup.</p>
      <p>And of course, Le Wagon wouldn’t have been the same without the people who support us throughout the bootcamp: students who come from different horizons, but also teachers, teaching assistants, Le Wagon staff, alumni… When you start the bootcamp, you’re in for 9 weeks of spending a lot of time with amazing and passionate people - and that’s a very energizing experience.</p>
      <p>Right now, I’m working on my project, using the skills I gained in the bootcamp to develop a website to present my project, get people to book and pay online. This helps me consolidate what I have learnt during the bootcamp, while gaining new skills and giving me the opportunity to work with even more autonomy!</p>
      <p>To put it in a nutshell, doing Le Wagon was definitely one of the best decision I've made! It has opened new perspectives for me - as it will for you !, by bringing me new valuable skills and creating lasting bounds with people among the very supportive community of Le Wagon alumni.</p>

      <p>I always knew I was interested in becoming a Web Developer but I was doing a non-technical degree at university and wasn't sure I would find work as a developer afterwards. (I studied French). I was teaching English abroad and when I was asked to teach a Technology course I realised I was a lot more interested in coding than most of my students...this was when I seriously started looking at becoming a dev.</p>
      <p>I ended up picking Le Wagon for a couple of reasons - the reviews were pretty unanimous that it was a great place to study, and it was also only 9-weeks long and I wanted to get working ASAP so I didn't mind signing up to something pretty intensive.</p>
      <p>It was definitely more than 'pretty' intensive but I had the most amazing time doing it. I'd already done a fair bit of HTML/CSS before the course but it feels ridiculously insignificant after an intensive week of JavaScript lessons! They also teach you to code properly --what to avoid/best practices-- which I'm so grateful for in hindsight. It's more than just knowing how to code, but also how to deploy an app from scratch along with a tonne of other really useful lessons.</p>
      <p>A lot of people said the first couple of weeks were very tough and they were right, but IT'S SO WORTH IT. Le Wagon is definitely a 'work hard/play hard' kind of place. The teachers were all amazing and they went above and beyond when we got stuck. (Especially in the last two weeks of project-deadlines!) It doesn't stop when you leave, either. Everyone is so happy to help with issues post-course and there's a brill alumni network.</p>
      <p>I loved learning to code in Ruby, but when we got to frontend, i completely fell in love and had my fingers crossed for a great job as a front-end dev (which I found just a couple of weeks later).</p>
      <p>Taking Le Wagon has quite literally changed my life - I'm doing what I've always wanted to do.</p>

      <p>I’ve always been interested in technology and have wanted to study it ever since I was a kid, but school just wasn’t teaching me what I wanted to learn so I left when I was 18. I looked into some coding bootcamps and Le Wagon was clearly leading the game with the best reviews, highest ratings, most interesting alumni projects.</p>
      <p>So I started in London in January 2017 and I learnt more technical skills in the space of 2 weeks than I did in my entirety of formal education! Even my friends who decided to go to university can’t compete with the scale of things I can now create.</p>
      <p>Le wagon has kickstarted my career and I even got my first project by meeting their alumni! Joining Le Wagon was the best decision I’ve made in a long time and I still miss going there every day and being in the environment of constant learning.</p>

      <p>Before Le Wagon, I spent about a year doing various online courses to try to learn how to code. They taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, JS and some other areas of programming but I couldn’t build anything completely from scratch and couldn’t tie together what I knew with any degree of confidence.</p>
      <p>Le Wagon’s bootcamp was exactly what I needed. It took the bits and pieces I already knew, filled in the gaps and amalgamated all of this knowledge so I now have a much better understanding of the bigger picture of web development and programming in general.</p>
      <p>The teachers were fantastic and I studied alongside some wonderful people who I still keep in touch with. The pace of the course is fast and it makes for a very intense 9 weeks but you learn so much every day and the structure of the day ensures you get time to practise extensively and then digest and consolidate everything with evening live code sessions.</p>
      <p>I’m currently working as a junior web developer and finally feel as though I have the skills (not to mention resources!) to build web applications in Ruby on Rails and build on the solid foundation that the bootcamp provided me with. Highly recommend to anyone that wants to learn to code!</p>

      <p>When I decided to change my career, I quickly realised that I needed to acquire new skills in a fast way, so no university, no Masters, no Bachelors. After benchmarking several Coding Schools, Le Wagon seemed to the best choice based on countless reviews, curriculum, price, duration and staff, and I was correct!</p>
      <p>When I started my coding journey at Le Wagon, I brought with me some tech skills that I acquired during my BSc in Computer Science and during my previous job as an IT Consultant. I've learned so much over the course of 9 weeks, even though I had some prior knowledge before the bootcamp. Le Wagon offers a well structured curriculum, starting from the very beginning and building up to more complex topics and finally allowing you to build complete apps. Each module is taught by teachers who have the perfect knowledge of the material covered during these modules and who know the market.</p>
      <p>During the bootcamp I've noticed that Le Wagon connected us to the tech industry through inviting companies, visiting tech events and tech job fairs and by providing and sharing job opportunities.</p>
      <p>The value of the bootcamp is very present, at least in Amsterdam, because companies there have a great acceptance of the bootcamp. For example, I found a job as a junior Ruby on Rails developer, during the last weeks of the bootcamp, when I was working on my final project.</p>
      <p>Le Wagon's does not only teach the programming skills but also implements a business view throughout the entire program, by the end of the course, everyone is able to understand the value of an idea, design and implement it, using cutting-edge technologies and frameworks.</p>
      <p>Each person who is part of this course must be aware that they will belong to a community among entrepreneurs and developers. After the bootcamp they are all part of the global Le Wagon alumni family.</p>
      <p>If you are the type of person that, want to learn cutting-edge technologies, understand the business behind an idea, be part of a tech community, build your own applications and want to maintain a close relationship with tech companies then I would highly recommend to join Le Wagon.</p>

      <p>I used to work as a structural engineer but I was not satisfied with the day to day challenges and the work I had to do. I wanted to join a startup with a more young, dynamic environment but I didn't have any transferable skills. A friend of mine suggested I joined le wagon.</p>
      <p>My experience at le wagon has been very positive. Not only because of the actual course and how in 7 weeks I had learned enough to code my final product in 2 weeks but also because of the community at le wagon and the network it has created for my professional career.</p>
      <p>I am now looking for a job as a web developer and in only one week of finising le wagon I have been getting multiple responses from various startups to set up interviews and discuss how I would fit in their team.</p>
      <p>If you want an intensive course that will open many doors in the start up industry or web development world and have no prior coding knowledge I would definitely recommend joining le wagon!</p>

      <p>My name is Theodore, I am French, 29 years old. Born and raised in Paris, I studied Business and Finance at McGill University (Montreal) for 4 years and then a master “Grande Ecole” at EM Lyon (Lyon and Shanghai).</p>
      <p>Right after this, I started straight in market finance as an equity derivatives and structured products sales at BNP Paribas for three years. First in Paris, then NY and finally London. Although these were very fun years of my life, I was introduced to the great world of tech and startups in NY and got very passionate about it. Along with the realization that finance is not what it used to be, I felt the urge to do something more creative with my life…</p>
      <p>Hence, with two friends of mine, and with little tech knowledge, we decided to quit our jobs and create our first startup (a social marketplace for home services called Hively).  That went on for 8 months until strenuous disagreement on entrepreneurial style and vision led us to part ways. So it’s a pretty classic startup story with all the lessons that come with it: 1. Starting a business with friends is hard. 2. Having little tech knowledge is not an advantage. 3. Paying a dev agency to build your mvp is both expensive and inefficient.</p>
      <p>A friend of mine and LeWagon alumni was often telling me about coding bootcamps and I felt the urge to jump into coding. First to get a general understanding of code and second to be able to build the mvp of my next startups by myself. So in Jan 2017, I started LeWagon in London. Boy what a ride. I truly loved that intense experience. I met great people, found out that code does not burn and is actually really cool. If you think (like me) that Excel is fun, wait until you start code. It’s Excel fun x10. Last two weeks at LeWagon, we worked on a idea of mine which is to build a premium livestreaming platform for influencers. We had a lot of fun and we still do because we (4 LeWagon classmates and myself) are working on it now and we should be able to launch it pretty soon. It’s called Socialive.TV, hope you like it!</p>
      <p>That’s it from me, I think everyone should learn to code and LeWagon is a great place to start. The community is great so if I were you, I would not hesitate. Personally, LeWagon was the best decision I made in a long time.</p>

      <p>I was looking to change my career from sales to being a web developer, so I did a lot of searching on the web. I saw Le Wagon has five stars so I contacted them and they invited me to their demo day in December 2016.</p>
      <p>I was surprised how amazing their presentations and products were. I had a word with a few of the students and most of them didn't know how to code before they join Le Wagon and that’s what made me so comfortable joining the bootcamp.</p>
      <p>They do tell you that the first weeks you really need to stay focused. So I did, and  I can’t believe that 9 weeks later I was presenting and launching my own product, Desk Joy, in front of a crowed at Google Campus. It was an amazing experience and now I have a strong foundation to move forward as a developer or to build my own products.</p>

      <p>I had been wanting to learn coding for a while before enrolling to Le Wagon. I started learning with some online services but was not convinced. After benchmarking several bootcamps in both US and Europe, it seemed Le Wagon gave the best value for money.</p>
      <p>I didn’t regret one second joining them. The pedagogy - focused on practice - is extremely innovative. The courses are very well structured and engaging. The teachers are clear, professional and friendly. The technologies and methodologies you learn are what companies are using.</p>
      <p>By the end of the bootcamp, everyone is able to build their own app, and more importantly has the right basics to be able to keep learning new languages, frameworks and technologies.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, you become part of a community of entrepreneurs and developers which will be there to support you in your future challenges.</p>
      <p>Whether you want to become a developer, build your own product, be able to better talk to the tech guys in your company or are just curious about coding, I would highly recommend to join Le Wagon.</p>

      <p>I’ll give you some life context so that you can understand how Le Wagon legitimately changed mine. I left university midway through my degree in History and German. I didn’t feel that I was getting enough value to make the investment sensible. I was there because of ambition. I want to have a good career in a job that I enjoy. I went to an academic school in London and was taught that university was the only way forward after 18. To not go would be to forfeit my right to a successful future; to stagnate. Keep paddling, don’t rest, you’ll make it.</p>
      <p>I was on holiday in Lisbon, staying in a house share. Sitting at the kitchen table I saw fluorescent text tapping along a dark laptop screen. Coding, just like in the movies. It still excites me when I open up my laptop and see the arcane looking terminal and text-editor in which I do most of my work. I asked the guy operating the laptop how I might be able to sneak into his mystical world. He asked what I was studying. History I said. Well then, a coding bootcamp he said. And that’s when I found Le Wagon. Googling away and trying to find the best bootcamp in Europe. I hit gold, but I didn’t know it at the time. I applied, I got a place and I left university.</p>
      <p>I didn’t make my decision lightly and I was worried that Le Wagon wouldn’t live up to my hopes and dreams. That I wouldn’t like coding. The first three weeks are hard but immensely rewarding. At 9am the 90 minute lecture starts and one of Le Wagon’s great teachers guides you through a new concept. You have to concentrate. Every syllable is important to your understanding. You then split off into randomly assigned pairs and work through coding exercises until 5:30pm. This is where your brain strains as it shifts and develops new methods of function. You’ll get tired, you’ll sit in total frustration, you’ll feel brilliant. From 5:30pm-7:00pm a student will go in front of the class and try to solve a coding problem. Don’t worry if the thought of this intimidates you, it does most, but you won’t be alone up there, the class will work with you. On this course you learn hard skills. Through 400+ hours of coding you are born into the world of technology and what an awesome world it is. The next 4 weeks are also difficult but there is a shift in what is learned. It becomes much more visual, and your first three weeks come together to make sense. You really have to trust the process. Often times you might think, why are we learning this? It’s because Le Wagon is responsible. They don’t give you a whistle-stop, skim read, superficial introduction to coding. They dig the foundations deep to steady you for a whole future of explosive growth. The last 2 weeks are spent working on your final project in teams of 3-4. This is the stuff I love, creating something from nothing. Once again it’s hard but by this point you trust in your ability to make your vision a tech reality. I worked with a fantastic team to build a livestreaming platform (socialive.tv). We’re planning to launch soon!</p>
      <p>Le Wagon is up amongst the best things that I’ve ever done. I feel like I have a superpower, but like any good hero/heroine I’ve got to keep growing, learning, and adapting. That’s the world of technology and that’s what Le Wagon teaches you.</p>

      <p>Before knowing Le Wagon I was working at Ladbrokes (gaming industry) on offering customers new products. Obviously, every new product release had to come from the IT department and from developers. But daily meetings with them wasn't easy as computer science was hard for me to understand. Therefore, for a given product I had no idea of the necessary workload and I had no credibility among external providers. My frustration was at its height…</p>
      <p>Then, some friends told me about Le Wagon and its fast track coding course ending with a real product release. It was a good opportunity to learn quickly and in a structured way the art of coding. Besides, my colleagues and I had an idea for a new mobile game. This could be the perfect spot to build a prototype and to test its potential.</p>
      <p>For the first 9 weeks of 2017 I joined Le Wagon's London bootcamp and started to learn coding. It was not an easy course, everything was new. Teachers however knew they had newbies in the classroom; their pedagogy consisted of every day short theory lessons and many exercises. Coding was fun and every day was perceived as an achievement!</p>
      <p>Once the bootcamp was finished, I came back to Ladbrokes with a prototyped game and I also joined the IT department! I am now fully working on the development of the game, from defining its strategy to daily discussions with developers. I have gained confidence in computer science expertise and in every day discussions with the IT department.</p>
      <p>One thing is certain; le Wagon is an incredible experience and brings you much more than only coding skills!</p>

      <p>My background lies in sales where I first came in contact with a group of programmers in Malaysia. I was fascinated to see how a dedicated team of programmers, testers and designers were able to create a tech solution that helped companies engage with their target audience. The idea to work in a team and create a custom made solutions from scratch appealed greatly to me. Choosing Le Wagon as the place to learn how to code turned out to be a great decision.</p>
      <p>The bootcamp is well organised by people that truly care about their students and teachers. The teaching material is phenomenal, they basically succeeded in creating a summary of the internet on how to code in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery and much more. There is a structured approach for every module, day and exercise. Everyday you team up with one of your fellow students which creates great teamspirit and group dynamics but also improves your learning curve.</p>
      <p>The teachers are absolute specialists in their field of work and share a enthusiasm in teaching. They help you to think like a developer and look for solutions in the online documentation rather then just giving you the answers. In the final weeks of the Bootcamp you will team up in groups of three to build a web app from the ground up. This team effort is, in my opinion, one of the most important learning experience. You will have to apply most of your knowledge and work together by dividing tasks and merging changes online using Github.</p>
      <p>Finally, the community of alumni’s, teachers and students is truly remarkable. On the different Slack channels people share interesting articles, job opportunities, and you can ask for help with any specific problem in the #help channel. Also there are plenty of meetups where you can stay up to date on any new developments in the field of tech and also social events like wall climbing. Whether you want to become a developer, build your own product or any other reason, I would highly recommend to join Le Wagon.</p>

      <p>After studying graphic design and working for two years as a freelance UI/UX designer in Paris, I decided to join batch #48 because I wanted to be able to develop my own projects, from the first idea to an actual web app. And I was not disappointed!</p>
      <p>The pedagogical approach and teaching methods are designed to help the student to learn by himself and become an autonomous web developer, while learning how to work among others as part of a team — physically and online. Moreover, Le Wagon Paris staff is full of very cool and talented persons who care a lot about the welfare of all the people involved in this crazy adventure.</p>
      <p>After probably the 9 most intense weeks of my life, I was really proud and excited to present the MVP of mnemosyne.io, the project we built during the last 10 days with 3 other students — here is a link if you want to watch it. It’s a platform to share and discover art and design master theses. I’m now working on an alpha private version and hopefully a public beta version at the end of this summer!</p>
      <p>So if like me, you want to give life to your best ideas, I can only recommend you to apply to Le Wagon FullStack program. I promise you that you won’t regret it ;)</p>

      <p>I graduated in 2013 from a business school with a specialisation in finance, then worked for 3 years in startups before joining Le Wagon's Fullstack program.</p>
      <p>Being immersed in this tech environment and following the latest news on startups, certainly got me curious - but how do they do it? - and I slowly gained interest in code. I first tried to learn a bit by myself thanks to online resources. The problem was that learning code on and off through 1-hour lessons on my free-time turned out to be very difficult.</p>
      <p>I heard about Le Wagon a bit more than a year ago from an alumni and I instantly found the format was pretty suited to my needs. Learning a language and being operational in 9 weeks, it's magical. Quickly, I felt like I wanted to be able to understand this completely foreign language and I realised as well that it would be a tremendous asset the day I would decide to start a company on my own - one day - I applied right when I got the opportunity to do it.</p>
      <p>Yes, the bootcamp is truly demanding, but the methodology so efficient: theoretical classes - not too long to keep students' attention - followed by practical exercices to do in pairs, with a different buddy everyday. Classes allow to tackle basics and exercices to quickly assimilate them, pair-programming encourages socializing but also enables to improve faster by facing the questions of others.</p>
      <p>The last few weeks are dedicated to the development, in groups, of web applications that are pitched by the students. It is the opportunity to put into practice everything that has been previously learnt in smaller modules.</p>
      <p>And the result is... stunning, we built from scratch real web-applications that are fully functional, in no more than 2 weeks. I am very impressed by the speed at which we learnt all that, but also very proud of our project.</p>
      <p>During the bootcamp, I also realised all the possibilities that are brought by these new skills, and I know that they'll be useful in any type of job.</p>
      <p>As a whole, these 9 weeks are an amazing experience, I learnt a lot, met great people and found new professional opportunities.</p>

      <p>You are a creative individual and you don't have the tech skills to make your ideas real? You feel that your studies, even prestigious, haven't provided you these skills, focusing more on theory than practice? You want to change your life? Don't hesitate any more, just jump on the band wagon!</p>
      <p>I made this choice 6 months ago and I don't regret it! After a MSc in Engineering, I spent 5 years in a consulting company before I decided to launch my own startup: ZADL, a service to plan paid events between friends.</p>
      <p>In order to test this idea, I needed a fully functional MVP, and I didn't want to delegate the development of the product. Sadly, I had no programming skills to handle it on my own. At this time, I heard about Le Wagon from a friend very connected to Paris startup ecosystem. I made my own investigation calling a bunch of alumni! They were all extremely enthusiastic about their experience. I was convinced at this point and I just jumped in. I was part of batch 43 and did the 9-week course from October to December 2016.</p>
      <p>In only 2 months, we went through all the basic skills a beginner needs in order to build a web application from A to Z. Ruby programming for the backend side, SQL for the database, HTML/CSS and Javascript for the front-end part, and also very useful product design tools like Sketch or Marvelapp. We also learnt how to collaborate within a developers' team using Github, and used Ruby on Rails to speed up our app development and not re-invent the wheel for every new web application. During the 3 last weeks of the programme, we worked on two projects, that we built completely and put in production with Heroku. One of these projects was my startup idea, http://beta.zadl.fr/.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, Le Wagon made me save nearly 2 years compared to what I would have learnt on my own with online MOOC and tutorials. Le Wagon's program is really intense and requires a 100% commitment. But there is also a very cool atmosphere, with a team of dedicated and passionate teachers and teaching assistants. Besides the "coding" part, Le Wagon also connect you to a great community: young grads, artists, engineers who want to switch their careers... We all helped each other during the 9 weeks and some of us really became close friends. After Le Wagon, part of my buddies pursued their entrepreneur's journey, and a lot of them started working as developers, either doing freelance or in full-time positions.</p>
      <p>To conclude, I would recommend Le Wagon to anyone willing to learn how to build a web application with a very thorough curriculum and an amazing students' community, that be for working on your own project or literally for changing your life!</p>

      <p>Le Wagon is worth the investment and lives up to its reputation. Before joining the bootcamp I was trying to follow online tutorials to learn how I could build some prototypes of ideas we had for web apps but with the feeling I would never be able to leave the training wheels and ride on my own. I found Le Wagon by chance and seeing that the technology stack covered in the programmed matched what I was trying to learn, it looked like a perfect fit.</p>
      <p>The program is demanding and fast-paced, but it is aimed and suited at complete beginners, although I feel that if you take the time to explore the technologies covered before starting you will get so much more out of this bootcamp.</p>
      <p>The teachers are experienced in software engineering and they approach topics both from practical standpoints as well as theoretical. The teaching staff is always available to help you with your doubts at all times.</p>
      <p>There’s alsomore than simply coding though. Le Wagon organises talks and interviews with entrepreneurs and people involved in the start-up scene, which greatly complements the content of the course.</p>
      <p>What really surprised me was the atmosphere between students and that’s something Le Wagon staff fosters and encourages – creating a network of contacts and fellow-students which will continue beyond the bootcamp.</p>
      <p>The pace of the last two weeks is hectic due to the final projects but that’s where it all comes together. My team and I built a web app to track routines through user created questions/forms and it was great to see that I was able to build and structure a product on my own that differed from what I had been taught.</p>
      <p>Now I understand why some of the reviewers wrote that Le Wagon changed their lives or that it was the greatest thing they’ve ever done. It’s not cliché. Even if you don’t plan on becoming a developer, it is an enriching experience and a fantastic coding program. As for me, I found something I really love doing.</p>

      <p>Le Wagon is worth the investment and lives up to its reputation. Before joining the bootcamp I was trying to follow online tutorials to learn how I could build some prototypes of ideas we had for web apps but with the feeling I would never be able to leave the training wheels and ride on my own. I found Le Wagon by chance and seeing that the technology stack covered in the programmed matched what I was trying to learn, it looked like a perfect fit.</p>
      <p>The program is demanding and fast-paced, but it is aimed and suited at complete beginners, although I feel that if you take the time to explore the technologies covered before starting you will get so much more out of this bootcamp.</p>
      <p>The teachers are experienced in software engineering and they approach topics both from practical standpoints as well as theoretical.   The teaching staff is always available to help you with your doubts at all times.</p>
      <p>There’s alsomore than simply coding though. Le Wagon organises talks and interviews with entrepreneurs and people involved in the start-up scene, which greatly complements the content of the course.</p>
      <p>What really surprised me was the atmosphere between students and that’s something Le Wagon staff fosters and encourages – creating a network of contacts and fellow-students which will continue beyond the bootcamp.</p>
      <p>The pace of the last two weeks is hectic due to the final projects but that’s where it all comes together. My team and I built a web app to track routines through user created questions/forms and it was great to see that I was able to build and structure a product on my own that differed from what I had been taught.</p>
      <p>Now I understand why some of the reviewers wrote that Le Wagon changed their lives or that it was the greatest thing they’ve ever done. It’s not cliché. Even if you don’t plan on becoming a developer, it is an enriching experience and a fantastic coding program. As for me, I found something I really love doing.</p>

      <p>I started studying computational linguistic a year before I joined Le Wagon. Before my studies, I had zero computer skills, to the point I that I had to call my brother every time I installed a new program or something was off. I started programing in university but I knew my skills were by far not good enough to land a job as a working student in the hopes of becoming one day a great software engineer. I decided to go to a coding bootcamp to make up for all those years missed not programming and to accelerate following my dreams.</p>
      <p>The bootcamp proved to be tough. By day 5, I was already learning things I hadn't seen in university before. The struggle began and didn't end until Le Wagon finished nine weeks later. I learned so much in such a short time. I could never have done this on my own and I don't think it’s possible to achieve that much when you are on your own.</p>
      <p>Le Wagon’s teachers were a great help, answering all my personal questions and always keeping us motivated. Going through a process like this wouldn't have been bearable if it wasn't for the other students though, we pushed and helped each other and formed our own little community.</p>
      <p>The last two weeks we worked in groups to make a final project which we presented on the final day. My group created a prototype to handle freelancer invoicing. It was really hard work but an opportunity to focus on the things we like, for me backend, but also to get better at the ones we struggled with - frontend.</p>
      <p>Going to Le Wagon is perhaps one of the best experiences of my life. I would't be able to work as a software developer right now if it wasn't for those 9 weeks.</p>

      <p>My experience in the bootcamp was more than I could have expected. It started a bit scary and overwhelming in the first weeks but once time passed and programming and ruby notions were quickly building up in my head, it became more and more fun. The more I learned, the more possibilities I could envision. Honestly, I didn't think that I could learn how to build a fully functional web app in 9 weeks, but hey! it did happen!</p>
      <p>Also, what really made the bootcamp for me, was the people involved - teachers, the driver, and all the other students. Its much easier to learn when everyone is heading in the same direction.</p>
      <p>Learning to collaborate is a very important step, and the final weeks of the bootcamp are all about collaboration. I saw 10 amazing final projects built from 27 students in 2 weeks and I felt happy and proud of everyone!</p>
      <p>My final project was a Facebook Messenger Bot that can pretty much work as a receptionist for a small hotels/hostels. And yes, in two weeks, my group figured out how to actually make it work.</p>
      <p>The feeling that stuck with me after finishing the bootcamp was that now I have the freedom and the tools to build anything I want and that feels really good! I loved it, definitely recommend it and wish I could do it again.</p>

      <p>My idea to join a Coding Bootcamp goes back way before I heard about Le Wagon. My first contact with Le Wagon was in an TechCrunch article and what really impressed me the most was the synergy between 'coding' and 'entrepreneurship’. With a background in finance, I felt learning to code would be valuable and also help me get involved in the startup scene.</p>
      <p>The decision to dive into a bootcamp is not an easy one -the value is huge, but the investment money/time is also considerable. After a few days at Le Wagon batch #28 in Lisbon I realized my investment was a smart one.  I really felt the time and money put into the program was being invested back on me from everyone involved.</p>
      <p>Two months have passed since I finished my bootcamp and I am already working as a software developer in one of the most promising economic data platforms on the web. I found out that the most valuable thing I took from Le Wagon, is not the specific skills I learned there, but the understanding that if i put 120% of myself into something in 9 weeks the amount of knowledge one can gain is incredible.</p>
      <p>Seriously, if you are in doubt, just do it.</p>

      <p>My history with Le Wagon began e few years ago, I had just presented an IT recruiting system at a Ruby meetup in Paris and chance had it that someone from Le Wagon came to this same event to present their Bootcamp. The idea of learning to code started to sprout - but with a 9 to 5 job it would not be easy to find the time for a two months full-time bootcamp.</p>
      <p>Some springs later, destiny (or rather my wife) made me move to São Paulo. So I quit my job and started learning Portuguese. Once again, destiny made things right when I heard that Le Wagon had just launched their bootcamp in São Paulo. This time I had the available time and I jumped on the opportunity to apply to their next batch.</p>
      <p>It started with an interview with the person in charge (Mathieu Le Roux), I felt lucky that he happened to be French since my "portuñol" was not that great. We talked about my motivations, in my case I had been working with digital for the past 6 years. I had a multitask profile: product launch, marketing, product management, acquisition strategies, mobile apps... but always felt frustrated for not being able to master 100% of the product chain. The interview went well, I just needed to complete an online course so that my application would be valid.</p>
      <p>One month later the bootcamp started and I felt the first week was really tough. Lots of new concepts everyday had me come home every night with some heavy headaches. It's only after the third week that I felt things became clearer to me, just when we actually connect all the concepts to concrete practical applications. From then on, things started to feel more natural and automatic. After that we had a few more weeks to learn Front End, which for me was easier since I had already created some sites using HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>And finally, the two best weeks: the final project. Our small group of 4 people wanted to create a recruiting site targeted to developers, with a matching algorithm to find the best profile for each job offer. The team was extra motivated and we worked everyday up to 10pm. It was feature after feature: anonym and public profiles, search engine, matching algorithm, online payment, admin interface, responsiveness...</p>
      <p>The last day finally arrived and it was the moment to demo our product: programathor.com.br. Even though I had improved my Portuguese during these two months, pitching the project myself was still a little bit out of reach. So Julien and Leandro got the responsibility to demo the project, and they brilliantly did!</p>
      <p>After Le Wagon I am still considering launching ProgramaThor as a proper business in Brazil and keep improving the platform so I don't forget what I've learned. I'm impressed and proud of what we have accomplished in only two weeks and of what I feel capable of doing after only two months.</p>

      <p>I attended Le Wagon batch #46 in São Paulo, Brazil, and it was a truly transformative experience. I’m 23, and a soon-to-be business graduate from HEC Paris, France. After interning twice in VC, it quickly became clear that I needed to considerably improve my technical skills, whether I was to stay in VC start a company or join a product management team in a startup, which were the three main options I am considering for my first job out of college. So I started working on FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy, putting 300+ hours in learning to code in JavaScript, Python and Ruby. I quickly got the grasp of algorithm coding, but I was far from being able to build the web apps I was dreaming of: the transition from coding algorithms to actually building software was much bigger than I expected, and I couldn’t find the right e-learning program for me. Working and studying, my time was limited, and it was clear I had to go another route if I wanted to quickly improve my skills. Living in Brazil at the time, I met the formidable team of Le Wagon in Sao Paulo, and signed up for the next session.</p>
      <p>The next two months have been incredible. I had the chance of attending le Wagon in a small batch of 12 students, which considerably improved the experience and helped built a great relationship between students and teachers.</p>
      <p>After 7 weeks of learning and practicing, I gained the skills to build EasyMoveis, a furniture rental marketplace (www.easymoveis.co) in only 10 days with a team of 4 LeWagon students. I was most impressed by the fantastic learning curve at Le Wagon. The learning program is very well engineered so that the transition from coding to actually building web apps is extremely natural. I started building apps without realizing it! Aside from building apps, I think Le Wagon also helped me build a ‘developer’ mindset, that is the ability to keep learning on my own, find resources and libraries, and more importantly collaborate on a project. All those skills simply can’t be taught online. Finally, I am glad to have joined the Le Wagon community: the teachers from my batch at Le Wagon are always happy to help and provide feedback, while the overall community is super active and helpful.</p>
      <p>Le Wagon is probably the best investment I made on myself, and I would recommend it to any one willing to learn software development, eyes closed!</p>

      <p>I had never coded a single line before in my life, but those classes were so complete that after only 9 weeks I am now confident enough about my code skills to apply for a tech position.</p>
      <p>For the past 3 years I worked with Marketing and Communications, but right after Le Wagon I started applying some logic knowledge and hacks in my daily tasks and this led me to get a spot in the tech team of my company!</p>
      <p>It's only two months to become a fullstack dev so you have to dive in code everyday but it is totally worth it! I am fully satisfied and recommend Le Wagon to everyone looking for a quick start on coding. Besides Le wagon provides you with an amazing network of alumni and teachers that help you even after the bootcamp is over.</p>

      <p>First of all I totally recommend doing Le Wagon bootcamp if you are keen on entering the programming world. Before doing Le Wagon last winter here in Brazil I was kind of worried about my future and having a hard time finding a good job. I have studied and worked with oceanography here and before the bootcamp I was disappointed with the lack of opportunities in my field, I spent more than a year looking for a job and nothing came up.</p>
      <p>Work with programming was something that I always thought about, but the initial learning curve was very discouraging. So coding bootcamps were already in my mind to break through this curve. Then I heard that a really good bootcamp was landing here in Brazil, so I thought it was my chance of changing. I ended up being the first student to enroll in the first brazilian batch.</p>
      <p>And let me tell you it’s been an amazing experience, I have met really good people and looking back I still cannot believe how much me and all my colleagues could learn in only 9 weeks. This is the most interesting point where Le Wagon stand out, it's a very well structured and crafted program. And it explains how they manage to have anyone learn so much so fast.</p>
      <p>Their philosophy is learning by doing, and that's also another diferenciating fact about them. You really get your hands dirty and « squeeze »  your brain. The last 2 weeks are devoted to a project which teaches you how to work in team and release a functional project in only ten days. Some of my teammates are still working on the project that is turning into a startup called numooh. Check it out!</p>
      <p>Two months after I finished the course I’ve been involved in some freelancing dev for a nice French startup and just got hired in another major startup here in Brazil. (Gympass, the netflix of gym club :) So, in my opinion, if you seriously want to dive into this world with a solid understanding of what’s going on. You should consider Le Wagon.</p>

      <p>Avant la formation du Wagon, je venais de quitter un poste de pre-sales pour une startup marseillaise. J’avais un gros background technique puisque j'ai travaillé 20 dans l'informatique. Pour autant mes connaissances techniques commençaient à dater et comme je portais un projet de startup dans le Théâtre, il fallait réactualiser mes connaissances en code. Par hasard j'ai croisé Louis Chavane, CEO du Wagon Aix-Marseille, à un meetup sur Sketch. J'ai tout de suite voulu y enseigner, mais je devais d’abord mettre à jour mes connaissances et me former sur Ruby.</p>
      <p>L'esprit du Wagon est certainement la chose qui m'a le plus plu pendant mon stage de 9 semaines ! J’ai apprécié la bienveillance des professeurs et la culture du partage omniprésente. J’attendais beaucoup du Wagon car pour développer mon projet, je savais que j'allais avoir besoin d'un savoir-faire pragmatique et opérationnel. Effectivement, j'ai eu la chance de pouvoir travailler sur mon projet IMPARATO, l'application pour les comédiens. Et je continue de monter mon projet IMPARATO aujourd’hui. En parallèle, j'enseigne au Wagon Aix-Marseille et c'est un réel plaisir de transmettre, à mon tour, les connaissances et l'esprit du Wagon.</p>
      <p>Les résultats ont vraiment dépassés mes attentes ! J'ai découvert une équipe exceptionnelle, des élèves captivants, une communauté enthousiasmante et la formation vraiment bien pensée. Maintenant que je suis Teacher, j'ai aussi découvert à quel point elle était intense et dans l’accompagnement de l’élève. C’est un vrai plaisir de la transmettre à mon tour. Le Wagon fait parti de mon parcours et j'invite souvent les entrepreneurs que je croise à tenter l'aventure du code au Wagon Aix-Marseille.</p>

      <p>Avant de passer par le Wagon j’étais graphiste spécialisée Print, j’ai travaillé en imprimerie et en agence. Dans mon métier j’aime apprendre les choses jusqu’au bout, comprendre les tenants et les aboutissants de chaque projet. Dans le Graphisme, il y a 2 grandes familles d’application : le Print et le Web. Après avoir expérimenté le print en profondeur, j’ai décidé de m’attaquer au web. J’ai trouvé la formation en pesant le pour et le contre de chaque organisme proposant une formation similaire. Ce qui m’a motivé, c’est l’idée de passer directement de la théorie à la pratique dans mon travail.</p>
      <p>Au wagon j’ai découvert comment optimiser le design que je crée, mais aussi comment le mettre en place concrètement. J’ai codé Manufact.co, qui sera (à terme) une plateforme qui met en relation les créateurs et les manufactures Françaises, dans le but de promouvoir la fabrication Made in France.</p>
      <p>Aujourd’hui je suis « Fullstack designer » freelance, j’interviens à chaque phase de projet, de la Direction artistique au Développement. J’ai trouvé les Teachers excellents, complètement ouverts aux difficultés de chacun. Ils ont su adapter leur discours pour être certains que l’exercice de code a bien été compris. Le tout dans une ambiance carrément entrainante et fédératrice ! Je recommande le wagon à toutes les personnes créatives qui en ont marre de passer pour des “colorieurs” auprès des tech !</p>

      <p>Avant la formation du Wagon, j’étais jeune diplômée en marketing et stratégie commerciale. J’étais à la recherche d’un job dans le domaine du marketing. Mais je ne trouvais pas « LE » job. J’avais appris toutes les notions stratégiques relatives au web. Il me manquait les connaissances purement techniques. J’ai donc décidé de faire le wagon pour acquérir ces compétences techniques. En rejoignant le Batch#53 du Wagon Aix-Marseille, j’ai été servie : Ruby, Html, Css, Javascript, Ajax, Jquery etc.</p>
      <p>Faire la formation du Wagon à Marseille m’a permis d’approfondir mes compétences, d’apprendre tous les jours de nouvelles choses avec l’aide des professeurs très passionnés. Avec mon équipe j’ai codé le projet « Manufact ». Il s’agit d’une plateforme mettant en relation les créateurs/porteurs de projet avec l’ensemble des acteurs de la chaîne de production/fabrication. Avec Alexis Fieujean et Andréa Simoes, nous avons décidé de continuer l’aventure commencée au Wagon et nous travaillons également sur de nombreux projets ensemble.</p>
      <p>Suite au wagon, j’ai donc décidé de me lancer en freelance dans le développement web. Cela fait un peu plus de 6 mois et je suis très contente : les clients sont nombreux, pas besoin d’aller démarcher ! Je recommande cette formation !</p>

      <p>Avant le Wagon j’étais ingénieur dans l’environnement à l’international, principalement en Afrique. Je voulais changer de vie et sortir de ma routine professionnelle, une envie de faire des choses plus pour moi et plus créatives. Je voulais apprendre à coder et j’ai trouvé la formation du Wagon Aix-Marseille par des recherches sur internet. Le slogan du wagon était fait pour moi ! En route pour le Batch #53 à Marseille.</p>
      <p>Les 3 premières semaines de code sont intenses et tous les jours on ajoute une couche ! Et pour autant la formation est bien construite, on ne travaille jamais seul, on s’entraide, on s’explique et on progresse ensemble. Je retiens tout particulièrement la super expérience humaine que j’ai vécue durant la formation. Les professeurs nous ont apportés beaucoup de briques qui aboutissent à un moment donné à un ensemble très cohérent et permettent finalement de réaliser des projets vraiment sympas. Avec Carine Fillot, Alexandre Perdomo et Fabien Martinez, nous avons codé Hack the Radio, un projet concernant la radio et les podcasts.</p>
      <p>C’est vraiment deux semaines chouettes, tout le monde est concentré sur cet objectif de présentation au Demo Day. Il faut gérer le travail en équipe, la répartition des tâches, les options techniques, tous les profs sont là pour aider et il y a vraiment une super ambiance. De temps en temps, on code sur la terrasse au soleil, un des avantages de Marseille ! Cet automne 2017, avec Carine Fillot, nous accélérons le projet Hacktheradio chez Paris Pionnières (Wodi) et à la nurserie Audiens. Nous allons bientôt pitcher notre produit à Harvard !</p>

      <p>Venant du monde de l’aéronautique, la programmation, je cherchais à approfondir mes connaissance en code. J’ai cherché sur Internet une formation et je suis tombé sur le Wagon. Par la suite, j’ai rejoint le batch#53 en Janvier 2017 à Marseille !</p>
      <p>Incroyable ! Le Wagon Aix-Marseille m’a permis de me réconcilier avec le monde du code que je détestais ! Les cours sont vraiment bien structurés et précis. Cela permet de comprendre les fondamentaux et surtout d’exécuter immédiatement les notions. J’ai beaucoup apprécié le Batch #53 avec lequel nous avons codé les produits les plus fous avec la fine complicité des profs.</p>
      <p>Il faut avouer que la promesse est audacieuse, et après 9 semaines, coder des produits web est bien une réalité ! Nous avons appris tellement de choses en deux mois et demi que j’ai eu l’impression d’avoir un deuxième diplôme d’ingénieur ! J’avais  essayé de me former par moi-même dans le passé, mais jamais je n’aurais acquis un tel niveau en si peu de temps. Je recommande à tous ceux qui ne connaissent rien au code et qui veulent apprendre de rejoindre l’aventure ! Le Wagon m’a donné les armes pour pouvoir coder mes idées. Maintenant c’est à moi de jouer !</p>

      <p>Avant de faire la formation du Wagon à Marseille, j’avais une idée bien précise de la start-up que je souhaitais lancer. Mais je me sentais trop dépendant des développeurs que j’avais pu rencontrer et dont je comprenais mal les devis. En recherchant sur google, j’ai trouvé « Apprenez à coder en 9 semaines ». Je me lance ! J’ai pris la décision de participer à cette formation sur Marseille et j’intègre le Batch 53  le 09 Janvier 2017 !</p>
      <p>Quand on embarque au Wagon, on apprend à coder en à peine 9 semaines et on se crée un réseau indispensable pour lancer sa start-up ! C’est une des grandes forces de la formation. La cerise sur le gâteau : les profs sont professionnels, patients, compétents, disponibles et toujours prêts à rendre service. J’ai codé en seulement 10 jours un projet de fin de batch avec mon équipe permettant aux jeunes artistes des beaux arts d’enfin vivre de leur passion.</p>
      <p>J’étais pour le moins sceptique avant de commencer la formation et j’en suis ressorti extrêmement heureux. Je mesure chaque jour l’énorme chance que j’ai eu d’y participer. 9 semaines après, je me retrouve doté de nouveaux superpouvoirs comme créer un site internet de A à Z ! Impressionnant. Un conseil : courez vous inscrire ! Vos trois premières semaines seront hard mais au final vous passerez 9 semaines aussi fun qu’enrichissantes !</p>

      <p>Après 15 ans dans le domaine des assurances, j’ai décidé en 2009 de reprendre mes études dans le marketing digital. Cependant, je bloquais toujours sur le même problème, trouver un développeur web qui construirait mes idées comme je le veux. Lors d’une conférence, Adrien Aumont - Co-fondateur de Kisskiss bankbank&Co a prononcé une phrase qui a tout fait changer : « Si je devais re-monter une startup aujourd’hui, la 1ére chose que je ferais, c’est d’apprendre à coder, pas pour devenir développeur mais pour comprendre le langage du développement web. » Il a ajouté avoir suivi une formation pour apprendre à coder en seulement 9 semaines au Wagon. Le lendemain je m’inscrivais et j’ai rejoint la formation du Wagon à Marseille le 09 Janvier 2017 !</p>
      <p>J’ai choisi d’apprendre à coder au Wagon à Marseille, loin du stress de la vie parisienne. Je me disais que coder devant la mer et le soleil apporterait des idées plus créatives ! La formation a été difficile : je mangeais du code le matin, le midi, le soir, le week-end et j’en rêvais même la nuit ! Et petit à petit, tout s’est mis en place et je comprenais le langage du code. J’ai pu m’en sortir car au Wagon, l’esprit d’équipe et la solidarité régnaient. Les formateurs, tous professionnels, tous dotés de très grandes qualités, ayant la capacité de s’adapter aux besoins de chaque personne, de chaque projets. Une équipe encadrante au top : humaine, à l’écoute, professionnelle et proposant des meetups de qualités.</p>
      <p>Je recommande cette formation à toutes celles et ceux qui souhaitent devenir développeur web ou qui ont des idées mais pas les outils pour les mettre en oeuvre !  Un conseil, ne baissez jamais les bras. Chaque petit pas créent de grandes enjambées et chaque avancée vous emmène vers votre but. LE WAGON, c’est avant tout une grande famille, une grande aventure humaine et pleines d’émotions qui fait ressortir le meilleur de vous-même !</p>
      <p>Merci Le Wagon Marseille !</p>

      <p>Après quelques années d’étude dans la filière scientifique, j’ai obtenu un BTS en production Audiovisuelle. Je me suis rendu compte que ce métier et Paris n’étaient pas en adéquation avec moi même. J’ai donc tout quitté pour venir vivre à Marseille. Et en tâtonnant, j’ai découvert que le code me plaisait énormément ! Puis  en recherchant sur Google, j’ai trouvé Le Wagon et j’ai rejoint le Batch#66 à Marseille.</p>
      <p>Me voici lancée dans une aventure de neuf semaines intensives. La formation est enrichissante, riche en émotions et les profs sont passionnés. Du jour au lendemain je sais coder une application web ultra performante ! Il n’y a rien de plus satisfaisant et excitant que de se dire à la fin de ces 9 semaines : regardez le site que j’ai codé avec mon équipe ! Regardez ce dont j’en suis capable !</p>
      <p>Cette école m’a tout de suite plu. J’ai tâtonné longtemps avant d’avoir trouvé ma voix. Je suis maintenant développeur fullstack en freelance et ça me plait. Je vous recommande le Wagon et plus spécialement celui d’Aix-Marseille ! Quoi de mieux que de coder au soleil avec la mer à proximité ?</p>

      <p>Cela faisait longtemps que je voulais apprendre à coder sans jamais passer sérieusement à l’action. J’étais convaincue que savoir coder, c’est comme parler anglais de nos jours, c’est indispensable !</p>
      <p>Je réfléchissais à plusieurs projets de création de boîtes dans le digital mais je n’avais aucune idée de la complexité technique de mes projets. Je voulais savoir bien m’entourer, choisir les bons développeurs et savoir interagir au mieux avec eux. Et je ne voulais pas raquer des mille et des cents à chaque fois que je voulais changer une virgule. Bref, c’était le moment pour moi de plonger.</p>
      <p>J’ai entendu parlé du wagon, « une formation intensive, pensée par et pour des entrepreneurs et orientée produits ». Sur le papier, c’est ce qu’il me fallait. Je suis allée à un Démo Day et j’ai été complètement convaincue et époustouflée par ce que les apprentis codeurs avaient pu réaliser en 2 semaines. Je me suis de suite inscrite au Wagon à Marseille et je n’ai pas été déçue.</p>
      <p>De supers profs, une promo au top, le soleil de Marseille, plus qu’il m’en fallait pour bien apprendre le code. Coder m’est apparu comme une activité passionnante, qui permet tout simplement de créer. Je suis sortie de la formation avec un prototype de mon projet et là je vais sortir ma beta.</p>

      <p>J'ai toujours était passionné d'informatique. Ceci étant mes choix et mon parcours m’ont éloignés de ma passion pendant des années, jusqu’au jour où en cherchant sur le web, j’ai découvert le Wagon. J’ai tenté l’expérience au Wagon à Marseille et j’ai intégré le batch#91 en juillet 2017.</p>
      <p>Le programme, l’ambiance et l’équipe pédagogique m’ont immédiatement donné envie de m’investir à fond dans la formation. En 10 jours seulement, avec mon équipe, nous avons codé une application Web : impressionnant !</p>
      <p>Aujourd’hui je suis vraiment content et fier de mon choix. Grâce au contenu de la formation expliqué par les supers teachers du Wagon Marseille,  j’ai pu en seulement 2 mois apprendre tout ce qu’il faut pour développer une web app. Depuis je suis devenu freelance et ai déjà décroché mes premiers contrats, je recommande vivement le Wagon à tout ceux qui voudraient apprendre à coder et à Marseille tout particulièrement car apprendre à coder au soleil fait un bien fou.</p>
