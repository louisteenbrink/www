## Why did you join Le Wagon ?

After two years of studies in web marketing, I started coding without precisely knowing what I was doing. At the time, I really wanted to be able to create web products. I started to explore the startup environment in Paris, to finally come upon Le Wagon. Then I took the plunge and joined the third batch. My friends were a bit sceptical and worried at the beginning, but I gave myself this chance and just went for it.

## What did you do after the fullstack program?

I kept on working on TrackGuru, the MVP I had built during the last two weeks of Le Wagon (dedicated to projects) to make it real and get users. Few months later, more than 500 people had subscribed to the platform. But I was spending most of my time in marketing tasks and I missed coding. I had this feeling I didn’t reach yet the point I wanted when I decided to join Le Wagon at first.

Therefore I decided to return there as a teaching assistant. In fact I was their first T.A ! Even more motivated, I joined the team as front-end developer to increase my expertise under the mentoring of Sebastien and Boris. In less than a year we released [Le Wagon Ondemand](https://ondemand.lewagon.org/), the [Alumni platform](alumni.lewagon.org) and the new version of Le Wagon's website. I sharpened my CSS, Javascript and React.js skills and kept doing some Rails of course!

## Tasting a digital nomad lifestyle

During this period of intense learning, you also learn a lot about yourself. About your own rhythm and needs. I made the mistake of spending months coding every day until 11pm in the night, forgetting a bit about other important things. At this point, I decided to experiment a new “digital nomad” lifestyle.

I moved for some weeks to Brazil. There I spent time in front of the Ocean, enjoying Yoga lessons. Quickly I realized I missed coding again. I thought about my TrackGuru experience and decided to launch a new product, same style, with a different angle, and of course tons of new skills. I took time to analyse my mistakes, and to refine what will be later [Hubum](http://www.hubum.com/).

With a bit of luck, last january, Adrien Coudriol, the [Mangrove](http://www.meetmangrove.com/) founder and batch #5 alumni, organised a freelance retreat in Essaouira. I joined him with 9 other persons in Morocco with the objective to create the Hubum platform from scratch in 20 days. 20 intensive days, 20 days to exchange some feedback about our respective projects. I had built the first version of Hubum when I came back in Paris. Thomas Deschamps joined me later on this project, he is now developing new features while I am improving the design and gathering a community around the platform.

## Hubum in few words?

[Hubum](http://www.hubum.com/) is the [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com) of electro vinyl releases.

The idea is to allow users to discover the vinyl release culture, and become a reference digger. What you need to know is that all labels are working closely with techno artists to produce their vinyl release. A vinyl album is a story by itself involving lots of individuals. Releases fans are crazy about it, and are part of a sensible and caring community, always looking for good new sounds, favouring quality to quantity.

In parallel, we try to engage a maximum of curators/guests by inviting them to share in exclusivity their discovery on the platform. The challenge is to find renowned influencers (artists, youtubers) willing to help us. Some great names joined us already: [Audu Simion](http://www.hubum.com/andusimion), [Moskalus](http://www.hubum.com/moskalus), [Judaah](http://www.hubum.com/Judaah666), [DDD](http://www.hubum.com/hurfyd), [Hurfyd](http://www.hubum.com/DDD)…

## Next step?

Continue to learn by teaching for Le Wagon in [Paris](https://www.lewagon.com/paris), [Brussels](https://www.lewagon.com/brussels), [Amsterdam](https://www.lewagon.com/amsterdam) or [Lisbon](https://www.lewagon.com/lisbon). I had the opportunity to coach a lot of students on their project from batch #4. Today, we are already at [Batch #18](alumni.lewagon.org/batches/18) and it is still with the same pleasure and excitement that I help students to push their products as far as possible in terms of features and graphic design. In return, students and teachers help me develop my product vision and my coding skills. It’s a win-win, and that’s why Le Wagon's teaching program is working so well!
