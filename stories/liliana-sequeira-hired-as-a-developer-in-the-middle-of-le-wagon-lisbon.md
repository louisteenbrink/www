## What were you doing before Le Wagon?

I studied electrical engineering. Despite finishing my thesis, I felt stagnant.  At the time, I was learning how to program alone, I started trying to do things and it did not go much further, I did not feel myself evolving.  My boyfriend suggested that I learn how to program at Le Wagon..  I decided it could be an opportunity to learn the basics I might have skipped.  I started April 10, 2017 with [Batch 71 in Lisbon](https://www.lewagon.com/demoday/71).

## How was the experience?

The course is very intense, from 9am to 7pm, and people who are not accustomed to programming, can find it even more challenging. The programmer's life is: Why does this work? Or why does this not work?

  I felt I was a bit ahead as there were students who had no programming background at all. I was the only engineer in the class which gave me a leg up as I already had the logic based mindset. Many of the initial difficulties when learning to program is developing a logical approach to problem solving.  With that said, I still learned a lot because it was a completely new language, Ruby, and framework, Rails. I was able to capture the basics I had left behind when learning on my own.

## You got work before you finished the course ... 

One of the advantages of Le Wagon is that teachers are able to follow our progress. One of the lead teachers, who’s also a senior developer at German startup, [MOO-XOO](http://moo-xoo.com/), told me that if I was interested, at the end of the course, they would like to discuss me working for them as a junior developer.  We talked about the company, what they expected from me and what I could expect from them.

Many times when we work in consultants, we see people who do not have great project experience and then do not get good practices or progress. My main concern was this: to find someone who could guide me at this stage. André, my senior, was available, and in the middle of the course I got a job.

## How is this first experience working in the area? 

At MOO-XOO, I do a little of everything. It’s a German event management software startup that wants to change their base to Lisbon. I have tasks and bugs I need to solve everyday. At the beginning, the tasks served more to get to know the software and to understand how it worked and then I was integrated into the team and I chose my tasks. As I evolve, I choose more complex tasks. This is also why it is important to have the support of seniors.

## What are your favorite tasks?

 There are three of us on the team. I have the option of front end and back end. I like both, but I do prefer backend because it has more challenges in terms of reasoning, and the frontend can be difficult to visualize.

## You work from a cowork space. How is it? 

We were in a private office before and wanted to be in a more stimulating environment, so we moved.  

## Do you think that being a woman harms or benefits you in this area? 

I do not think so. A lot of people think it's not the same thing. What matters is the individual’s capabilities. It does not matter if it's woman, man, tall or short.
