## Where were you before Le Wagon and what led you to enroll? 

Before Le Wagon I was at Essec Business School in France and I knew I wanted to work in a startup environment. I joined because my brother who was at Apple for 10 years did Le Wagon London and basically said it would change my life, so I did the course and will never look back.

## What were you hoping to get out of studying code?

My four years at a Business School were very theoretical and I strongly lacked the technical skills to actually build my ideas. So by combining my business school skills and coding skills I feel I now have the complete package. 

Having done an internship in a digital startup during my studies I had seen what developers could do and "coding" kept intriguing me since then. That is why after graduating I decided not to do a masters degree as most of my friends were doing and instead I decided to learn how to code at Le Wagon's bootcamp in London! I was amazed by its online reputation, specially on the international scene compared to other bootcamps I was looking at.

## Did you have any difficulties with learning during the Bootcamp, and (if so) how did you get over them?

The course was intense, as I expected it to be, but I was amazed by how good the structure of the course was. We would spend all day learning how to code and doing exercises without losing focus - unlike my university classes, where I often lost focus after 30 minutes of a lecture.

## What was the best part of your bootcamp experience?

The last fews weeks the classroom felt more like a company office as we all worked in teams to build our final projects. This was an incredible experience, we quickly got very passionate and proud of our projects, meaning we'd voluntarily spend late nights trying to make our websites look perfect or adding extra features. Before we knew it we were building fully functional websites in just a couple of days.

And that's how, thanks to Le Wagon, in just a few weeks I learned how to code and completely changed my career path and my way of thinking from business to web development with a business perspective.

## What are you up to now?

I am now a full-time member of the team running Le Wagon! I’m helping them to develop their educational platform and am also teaching and running workshops.
